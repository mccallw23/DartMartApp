Apple Crumble Pie,Food,Sweet Stuff,$7.99 ,/27.161 Oz,"While you might think pumpkin pie is the top pick for Thanksgiving Day dessert, as it turns out, the almighty apple consistently earns the highest marks in myriad un-scientific surveys on the subject. And it makes sense� fall is peak apple season, with fresh crops coming off the trees by the bushel, their sweet-tart flesh and delicious crunch ready to elevate the ever-so-humble pie crust to another level entirely. Trader Joe�s Apple Crumble Pie is a prime example of such pie perfection. Its filling of tender, Northern Spy apples is imbued with warm cinnamon, and nestled between an all-butter pastry crust shell and a crunchy, buttery oat crumble topping with notes of brown sugar. It can be warmed in the oven while you enjoy Thanksgiving Dinner, or served at room temperature with a cup of coffee the next morning. And at eight inches in diameter, it can easily serve six dinner guests (with or without a scoop of TJ�s Super Premium French Vanilla Ice Cream). Apple Crumble Pie for the win!

The Salt crystals are small, delicate, and flaky� the name means salt flower in Portuguese. This Salt contains more moisture than traditional sea salt. It�s preserved in a ceramic crock and topped with a cork lid, which helps protect the crystals and keep them from drying out�it�s a terrific vessel that makes this salt tremendously giftable, and also offers countless re-use options once you�ve enjoyed the contents.
Portuguese Flor de Sal can season all the dishes on your holiday table.

Korean Beefless Bulgogi,Food,Entr�es & Sides,$4.49 ,/10 Oz,"The word bulgogi literally means �fire meat� in Korean. The meat of choice in this popular dish is typically beef, sliced into thin strips, marinated in bulgogi sauce (basically a doctored soy sauce), and �fired� on a grill. We love this dish, and have explored some of our own versions, like Trader Joe�s Korean Inspired Bulgogi Beef Fried Rice with Kimchi to name just one. Continuing our exploration, we�ve chosen some less traditional territory in the creation of Trader Joe�s Korean Beefless Bulgogi.
The fire �meat� in this case is not meat at all. Instead, it�s 100% Beefless textured soy protein. Even so, the marinade is quite traditional, made by our Korean supplier (in the Republic of Korea) using common bulgogi- sauce ingredients, such as soy sauce, pear puree, garlic, ginger, green onions, and sugar. Though completely vegan, the texture of our Beefless Bulgogi is satisfyingly meat-like; and the savory, sweet, salty sauce adds authenticity (not to mention enjoyability!) to the whole eating experience.
Korean Beefless Bulgogi cooks from frozen in 3-7 minutes, depending on your chosen method. Serve it with a side of Organic Jasmine Rice, or in a stir fry with your favorite TJ�s veggies. Since we�ve already gone non-traditional, why not take it a step further and pack some TJ�s tortillas with this Bulgogi for truly inspired, totally meatless tacos?!",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qNxeFhVttsywnk_AI6UtScSy7OLe8d_r/
Cracked Olive Salad,Food,"Packaged Fish, Meat, Fruit & Veg",$3.49 ,/11.64 Oz,"Almost all olives must go through a curing process before they�re edible. Fresh, right-off-the-tree olives are full of an extremely bitter-tasting compound called oleuropein, which can be removed by submerging them in various kinds of solutions, or even just packing them in salt, for an extended period of time. In some cases, olive farmers prefer to �crack� their olives prior to curing, by smashing them just enough to allow the pit to be removed. These cracked olives, or olive schiacciate, as they�re known in Italy, absorb more brine than an intact olive as they cure, developing a deeper flavor and softer texture. And when combined with a mix of pickled veggies, capers, and savory seasonings, as they are in Trader Joe�s Cracked Olive Salad, they�re nothing short of a cracking good time.
Equally able as an appetizer, condiment, or side, each jar of Trader Joe�s Cracked Olive Salad is made with both green cracked olives and black pitted olives, capers, and a giardiniera-like mix of pickled cauliflower, carrots, celery, and red peppers, all suspended in oil that�s been seasoned with herbs like oregano and parsley. It makes a great topping for an Italian beef or muffaletta sandwich, a terrific topping for practically any style of pizza, and serves spectacularly well with a charcuterie board or cheese plate. Personally, we like to simply enjoy it as is, as an antipasto-like side for pasta or spread over a nicely toasted crostini.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pIApwWkj_2WIQdCmvLoEf92TIsOb0cFR/
Bulgur Pilaf with Butternut Squash & Feta Cheese,Food,Entr�es & Sides,$3.49 ,/14.1 Oz,"Drawing inspiration from the dish known across Greece and Cyprus as pilafi pourgouri, Trader Joe�s Bulgur Pilaf with Butternut Squash and Feta Cheese is a side dish for the ages. Each batch starts with a base of light, nutty bulgur wheat, which our supplier seasons with aromatic spices like thyme and turmeric. They then cook it in a mild vegetable broth with bits of sweet and earthy butternut squash until the bulgur takes on a tender, easy- going texture, before finally tossing it all with chunks of tart, tangy, feta cheese. Each forkful offers a variety of textures, from the soft bite of the squash, to the fluffiness of the bulgur, and the teeth-sinking satisfaction of the feta, all bound together by a delightfully savory flavor profile that pairs excellently with practically any protein.
In contrast to the pleasant complexity of its texture and flavor, this Bulgur Wheat couldn�t be simpler to prepare: just a few minutes in the microwave or on the stovetop are all you need to serve it nice and hot. That said, it can also be enjoyed cold, a bit like a tabbouleh, by emptying the bag into a bowl and allowing it to thaw in the fridge overnight. Either way, it pairs most deliciously with a hearty Mediterranean-inspired main course, like grilled Shawarma Chicken Thighs, pan-fried Gyro Slices, or yogurt-marinaded salmon kebabs.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yFiXzJR4wETmhxanJgStmr1CYEzH3rx0/

And now, we�re proud to introduce our first foray into plant-based seafood with Trader Joe�s Vegan Salmonesque Spread. Made with a base of dairy-free cream cheese, to which our supplier adds savory bits of plant-based smoked salmon, chopped dill, and tart, briney capers, each bite of this Spread effortlessly evokes the flavors of our classic Smoked Salmon Dip, all without containing any salmon�or any other animal-based products, for that matter. It�s downright Salmonesque!
Just like the original dip that inspired it, our Salmonesque Spread has a remarkable range of uses. For breakfast, it pairs perfectly with a well-toasted Everything Bagel.

Chicken Gyoza Potstickers,Food,Entr�es & Sides,$3.79 ,/16 Oz,"According to culinary historians, gyoza (�jiaozi� in Mandarin) were invented by the Chinese. It�s rumored that the potsticker came to be when a Chinese chef walked away from the stove while gyoza were boiling, the water boiled off, and the stuffed dumplings stuck to the wok. The crisped side proved to be quite pleasing.
We love good food stories as much as we love good dumplings, so once upon a time, we developed our very own Chicken Gyoza Potstickers. These crescent-shaped dumplings are made from wheat flour wrappers that enfold a flavorful filling of chicken, cabbage and onion, seasoned with soy sauce, sesame seed oil and ginger powder. Already fully cooked, our Chicken Gyoza Potstickers easily fulfill your preparation preference � steam, pan fry, microwave, or add to soup. Our favorite method is to heat oil in a pan (or wok); place the potstickers in the hot pan, bottom side down (creases up), and cook over medium-high until browned and crisped; (optional: carefully turn to brown each side); throw a little water into the pan and cover to steam the dumplings off the pan (take care to not add too much water, as the dough can start to come undone).

For aesthetically-minded foodies, it provides some nicely verdant visuals when cubed and served alongside charcuterie or melted into mac & cheese.

We break out the roasting pans that lay dormant from May to August and dust off our favorite roast chicken and root veggie casserole recipes. But just how will we season our chickens and casseroles (and fish, and turkey, and vegetables) this fall and winter? With Herbes de Provence, of course.
What is it, exactly? Herbes de Provence [ERB-duh-proh-VAHNS] is a mixture of herbs typical of the Provence region in the south of France. It wasn�t commercially available as a ready-to-use blend under that name until the 1970�s, and the specific herbs used in the blend can vary, as cooks choose different herbs to suit their taste. The blend in this jar, created exclusively for us in Florida, is comprised of thyme, marjoram, savory, rosemary, basil, sage and lavender, creating a savory, aromatic seasoning that can be used in a multitude of preparations.
So how, and when, can you use Herbes de Provence? It is usually added before or during cooking, often when oil is heating, which helps to draw out the aromatics and allow them to meld into the recipe. It lends a sense of elegance when roasted with vegetables, and provides a floral balance to savory roasted poultry or fish. And of course, what would the classic Chicken Proven�al be without this Proven�al-inspired seasoning?

Across time and countless cultures, salt has held immeasurable social, economic, and religious importance, and provided the etymological inspiration for words like sauce, sausage, �salad, salacious, and salary (among many others). All this to say: salt is pretty darn important! So it might as well be easy to work with, like it is with Trader Joe�s Sea Salt Crystals.

Here�s why: Shishito Peppers are enormously delicious and a bit daring, couldn�t be simpler to prepare, are famously finger-friendly, and make perfect appetizers.
Native to Japan (perhaps via Portugal, some speculate), the slender, green peppers have delicate skin and a slightly pleated surface that makes for a fresh crunch raw or a tender bite cooked.

So popping peppers is a bit roulette-y: mild, mild, mild, POW!... The hit of heat and suspense are addicting.
Minimal prep is the key to highlighting their bright flavor. Simply heat oil (olive or sesame) in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, and cook the peppers, turning occasionally, until they begin to blister on all sides.

Firm Tofu is most similar to the texture of all the raw meat and seafood we stock on our shelves, making it a popular meat alternative. Nutritionally, it has all nine essential amino acids, adding to that high profile meat alternative status Firm Tofu holds. Entirely plant-based, gluten free, high in protein while low in fat makes for a great addition to many dishes as the main protein component.

On average, each of us consumes 11.5 pounds of these robust root veggies a year. Can you even imagine how those numbers would increase if more people knew they could get carrots in (almost) all the colors of the rainbow? We�re on a mission to make that happen, one carrot at a time, with Trader Joe�s and the Organic Carrots of Many Colors.
A little history� until a few hundred years ago, carrots were most common in myriad colors. The Dutch combined a yellow carrot with a red one and came up with orange, their national color. These new carrots took hold and became the standard by which other carrots are judged. These days, the colorful originals are making a comeback, and while we�re big fans of orange carrots, we also have a strong affinity for the Organic Carrots of Many Colors. Every two pound bag is filled with a random assortment of yellow, cream/white, red, and of course orange carrots. They all taste like carrots � no surprise there � but their color really pops on a plate.
Slice these vibrant taproots into spears, present them on a tray, and serve them with your favorite dip.

From its striking red-orange hue (courtesy of annato, the same natural dye used in orange Cheddars) to its mild, caramel-y flavor, TJ�s Rutland Red Leicester possesses all the unique, delicious, and versatile characteristics you want in a special, cheese. It adds visual flair and savory sophistication to a charcuterie board, brings a delightful and somewhat spooky something extra to mashed potatoes and omelets, and pairs perfectly with a good I.P.A. or ale.

We like to engage in all discourse around baking, especially when it comes to chocolate, but to do so knowledgeably, we needed to create Trader Joe�s Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks. Made from 58.9% cocoa, a higher percentage than our chips, these chunks balance rich, dark chocolate with the perfect amount of sweetness. Unlike chips, these chunks are not formulated to hold their shape, so they melt more easily, thus covering more territory (in cookies, let�s say). And because they are irregularly shaped, you can expect some �chocolate debris� from chunks, but significantly less than if you were to chop the chocolate yourself. In summary, Trader Joe�s Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks promise premium chocolate flavor, are easily prepared and measured, and melt smoothly & quickly, which makes them exceptional for baking and candy making. They are also sensational for snacking. You don�t need to bake to enjoy great chocolate, after all.
Made for us by an esteemed French-Belgian chocolate company that now produces product in North America, our Chocolate Chunks are of the same caliber that high-end bakeries and notable candy manufacturers use. We think our customers deserve the best; price included.

Their slightly curved shape and narrow, lasagna-like side ruffles give them a real edge in holding onto pestos and meaty ragus. They cook to a firm, yet yielding, texture, with a delectable, tender chewiness. And, indeed, they�re much easier to hold with a fork than their longer, thinner counterparts. Try Trader Joe�s Organic Cascatelli with plenty of Turkey Bolognese or Pesto Rosso to see just how much these three aspects make a difference. If you�re anything like us, you�ll immediately want to try it again with a few other sauces � just to be sure, of course.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YosSC2v9rAjQ3H9hujywfKulAt8i-_LP/

Gochujang Paste,Food,Dressing & Seasoning,$1.99 ,/7.05 Oz,"With origins dating to at least the 1600s, and possibly earlier, gochujang isn�t so much an ingredient as it is an institution of Korean cuisine unto itself. Traditionally made from a mix of fermented soybeans, rice, barley, salt, and, of course, spicy red peppers, gochujang has a thick consistency and a delightfully complex flavor that�s a rare mix of savory, sweet, and spicy, all at once. In the case of Trader Joe�s Gochujang, we reached out to a supplier in South Korea who uses traditional fermentation techniques to achieve this uniquely delicious flavor profile, resulting in a highly versatile pepper paste that works just as well as a condiment as it does a soup base, a marinade, a dipping sauce, and so much more.
Our Gochujang�s beautifully balanced elements of sweet and heat make it an excellent choice for flavoring proteins of all kinds, from barbecued beef to pan-seared porkloin, crispy fried chicken wings to hearty tofu stew. It can spice up burgers when used as a spread, can be enjoyed with french fries either on its own or mixed with mayo, and adds a whole new dimension of flavor when added to noodle soups. And for a fun, fiery appetizer, it�s great for making kimchi-inspired quick pickles with salted smashed cucumbers.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CrTKUTMSL8TxOnM6hrIWFdjYPaqyn1l5/

Unlike your everyday pretzel, however, their increased surface area allows them to be used as a vehicle for a wide variety of dips, cheeses, spreads � even salsas, if you so choose � meaning these Pretzel Slims aren�t just delicious, they�re postively practical.
Made from just four simple ingredients (wheat flour, sugar, salt, and barley malt syrup), we reccomend dunking your Pretzel Slims into Pub Cheese (with or without Jalape�os), Organic Buffalo Style Hummus, or even a jar of Aioli Garlic Mustard Sauce.

But one might also say it�s not that simple, if you think about the challenge the Simply Eggless creators faced in coming up with a 100% plant-based, egg substitute that still cooks and tastes like real eggs. How did they do it? The key is lupin beans. These bright-yellow legumes�with a history dating back to ancient Egypt�have an egg-like texture and taste when cooked. This means Simply Eggless can be used in just about any way you might use real eggs.
Shake the bottle well, then pour into a medium-hot pan on the stove to make an omelet or scrambled �eggs.� Use the scramble in a vegan burrito, alongside our Soy Chorizo. You can even use Simply Eggless in your baked goods, substituting 3 Tbsp. for each egg in the recipe.

And though the ingredient list may be small, the flavors are anything but: ripe, well-rounded, and with only the faintest bit of acidity to keep things balanced, these Organic Pineapple Chunks will cover all your baking, grilling, stir-frying�or even just snacking�needs.
By packing these Chunks of Pineapple in their own juice, our supplier not only preseves their sweet, tropical flavor, but also keeps them super juicy and ready-to-eat, right out of the jar. In fact, one of our favorite uses for them is simply as a topping for yogurt, cottage cheese, or ice cream.

Mascarpone,Food,Cream and Creamy Cheeses,$2.99 ,/8 Oz,"Hailing from the Lombardy region of Italy just southwest of Milan, the Mascarpone story begins. While we got plenty of positives from Italy during the Renaissance, this fresh, cream cheese offering may be one of the best thing that came out of the turn from 16th to 17th century.
Unlike many of the other cheeses you�ll find in our refrigerators, Mascarpone is a pasteurized milk and cream cheese that is coagulated from the use of an acidic substances (in this case we use citric acid, but historically lemon juice and vinegar have been used). After the curdling, the whey is removed without pressing or aging resulting in a thick cr�me fra�che-like cheese with a fat content upwards of 60%+.
The final product is that of a smooth, thickened cream not far from the texture of whipped butter. This light texture continues with a mildly flavored, milky flavored cheese that is so mellow in flavor it can lend itself to both sweet and savory dishes. Mascarpone is used in tons of northern Italian dishes and desserts because the original flavor goes well with anything from mustard and spices to sweet cocoa and coffee.

Lemon Curd,Food,Nut Butters & Fruit Spreads,$3.49 ,/10.5 Oz,"If cheese is the only thing that comes to mind when you hear the term �curd,� it�s time to expand your culinary horizons. Simply put, fruit curds are a category of preserves in a class of their own, made by cooking fruit juice with eggs and butter. Typically served with scones or bread as an alternative to jam, fruit curds are woven into British teatime tradition�which is why our Buyer went straight to the source to develop Trader Joe�s Authentic Lemon Curd.
Our Lemon Curd is imported from England, where it�s been made exclusively for us for nearly 15 years. Cane sugar, whole eggs, and butter are slow-cooked in small batches with lemon juice concentrate, lemon oil, and pectin; because the characteristics of the lemon juice can vary slightly from batch to batch, this labor-intensive process is overseen by a kettle master, whose sole purpose is to stir the curd and monitor its flavor, satiny texture, and vibrant sheen until it�s just right. When the mixture cools, it transforms into a luxuriously thick, glossy, golden-yellow spread, imbued with the aroma of freshly baked lemon bars. Yum�
With flavors of rich butter and sweet sugar contrasted by bright, tangy lemon, you might refer to our Lemon Curd as �sunshine in a jar.� After all, a spoonful of the stuff has the power to brighten up breakfast, baked goods, and all sorts of sweets and treats in between. Slather it on toast or stir it into yogurt. Drizzle it on pancakes, or ice cream, or cheesecake. If you want to get fancy, whip up some heavy cream and fold it into the Lemon Curd for an almost-effortless tart or layer cake filling worthy of a royal afternoon tea.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WPmv-kBH9y_zaTLDeU6pSwfl9DYJxd2k/

Our Sliced Prosciutto is crafted for us by a well-known, award-winning Italian salumeri here in the U.S. They begin with full hams that are cured in the traditional Italian style, then allowed to age slowly for 10-12 months. As the hams age, their flavor intensifies and their character builds, resulting in richly-flavored Prosciutto that�s outstanding on Panini with arugula & Asiago, a natural with melon for brunch or hors d�oeuvres and super on a pizza � try it with pesto or a cream-based sauce and inch-long cuts of asparagus.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HSsgwWSEcKM3fZN_uKiC4jrB8MANF8AM/
Sriracha Flavored Baked Tofu,Food,Entr�es & Center of Plate,$3.99 ,/7 Oz,"One of the greatest things about tofu, aside from its obvious health benefits, is its ability to absorb the flavors of the marinades and spices with which it�s cooked. When you begin with naked tofu, marinate for a few hours, and then cook the tofu, it miraculously tastes just like the marinade. It�s tofu�s gift to chefs everywhere. Our gift to tofu-eaters everywhere is Trader Joe�s Sriracha Flavored Baked Tofu.
Using non-GMO sprouted soybeans, our supplier creates bean-curd by coagulating soy milk to yield soft, white curds. These curds are then pressed into firm tofu squares, which are subsequently marinated in spicy Sriracha for 12 hours and finally baked to perfectly textured, flavor-filled tofu. The long marinating process allows the tofu to absorb the sauce�s fiery spiciness and it�s subtle sweetness, along with a hint of garlic for an added depth of flavor. It also creates a red and white marbling that is as striking, as it is fiery-delicious.
Cut open the package and enjoy the Sriracha Flavored Baked Tofu just as it is�it�s cooked and ready to enjoy. Try it with our Organic Herb Salad Mix.

Boneless, skinless chicken thighs are seasoned with a shawarma spice marinade made of onion, garlic, sea salt, cumin, cinnamon, coriander, paprika, turmeric, and parsley.

Though it�d be handy, you do not need to have a vertical spit installed in your home to cook this Shawarma Chicken; a grill or an oven will do just fine. More than fine, actually.

Each organically- grown Blend starts with soft, yet delicately crisp, baby spinach, to which our suppliers add a collection of young spring greens, including crunchy chard and raddichio, peppery mizuna and arugula, and soft, fluffly butter lettuce and fris�e. Together, these lush, yet lithe, leafy greens make an excellent (not to mention effortless) base for a salad, or an equally tempting (not to mention texture-enhancing) topping for a burger, sandwich, or wrap.
Given this collection�s delicate nature, as well as the inherent earthiness of some of its constituent greens, we find that this Organic Baby Spinach & Spring Mix Blend pairs best with lighter, simpler dressings, like our Balsamic Vinaigrette, and mildly tart cheeses, like our Crumbled Goat Cheese. It comes triple-washed and ready-to-eat, right out of the bag, meaning it can go straight from your fridge to a sandwich or a salad bowl with ease.

Though it has no historical relation to the real General Tsao Tsung-T�ang, a 19th century military leader from Hunan and prominent figure in the Taiping Rebellion, it�s likely it was named in his honor as a nod to its creator�s Hunan roots, and specialization in Hunanese cuisine.

Plain Whole Milk Greek Yogurt,Food,"Yogurt, etc.",$0.99 ,/5.3 Oz,"Did you know? Greek yogurt isn�t specifically �Greek�, per se�it simply has that reputation due to the fact that a yogurt company with origins in Greece was one of the first to introduce yogurt to the U.S. that had most of its liquid strained out (called straggisto in Greece). While not solely a Greek invention, this technique is certainly popular in Greece, and elsewhere around the globe, since the straining process leaves it with its signature tangy yogurt flavor, but a texture closer to that of sour cream.
All that said: we love Greek yogurt. The tang! The texture! And we know you love it, too, because we sell more Greek style yogurt than you can shake a strainer at. Trader Joe�s Greek Yogurts are made for us by a �yogurteria� that scores big on tang, texture, and of course, value!

Of course, Trader Joe�s picked up on this with our Green Goddess Dressing and extended that line into the dip category with our Green Goddess Dip. Then we wanted to stretch the concept a bit, so we partnered with a cheese maker in New York to create a cheese that would be exclusive to Trader Joe�s and would include a distinct, green-herby character that could justify its name: Green Goddess Gouda.

Hot & Sweet Jalape�os,Food,"Packaged Fish, Meat, Fruit & Veg",$2.99 ,/12 Fl Oz,"Most people know the famous tongue twister where Peter Piper picks a peck of pickled peppers. Well, thanks to a palatable new pepper offering, we�ve decided to reword it. �Trader Joe�s picked a peck of Hot & Sweet Jalape�os�� Sounds rather catchy, we think.
The developers of our Hot & Sweet Jalape�os originally came upon a jar of candied jalape�os in Kansas City, Missouri. The concept piqued their interest but the peppers were just a little too sweet. So, for this product they concocted the perfect balance of sweetness to complement�but not overpower�the heat of the jalape�os. And, yes, these are spicy; they�ll certainly pack the punch you�d expect from the small but mighty jalape�o. Grown in Mexico and Canada, the sliced jalape�os are pickled in a concoction of sugar, vinegar, salt, jalape�o puree, garlic, and a whole red chili pepper. The final result? A palatable, perfectly pickled�and sweet�pepper.
Perplexed about how to put our Hot & Sweet Jalape�os to use? Pop �em in your mouth like candy. Top a heap- ing plate of nachos with several slices. Spice up a hamburger or grilled cheese. Add to guacamole. Serve with crackers and cream cheese. Place as a pickled accompaniment for charcuterie. And then, when the jalape�os are gone, use the brine for a marinade. The possibilities are plentiful!",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I6WU-sqLykxxIdrpngHwf2_Bd_54xCgS/
Vegetable Biryani with Vegetable Dumplings,Food,Entr�es & Sides,$2.99 ,/10 Oz,"Sometimes, it�s good to eat old food. Mind you, we�re not talking about food that�s been stashed and forgotten for weeks in the back of the fridge. Think recipes with rich and storied histories. Trader Joe�s Vegetable Biryani with Vegetable Dumplings is based on a traditional South Asian recipe that�s been celebrated in the Indian region for five centuries. And, it�s made with ingredients that have been enjoyed for thousands of years!
Traditional Biryani is Basmati rice, steamed separately and layered with vegetables and/or meat that have been pan-fried with an intricate blend of aromatic, dry spices. Once combined, the mixture is finished in the oven. Because we like you, we�ve undertaken this multi-step cooking process for you� leaving just two things for you to do: heat and eat!
Our Biryani is vegetarian, including the tender �kofta� or dumplings, which provide a textural contrast to the firm rice and veggies. As is customary, we�ve thrown in some sweet raisins and sliced cashews. This diverse blend of traditional ingredients yields an exciting exploration into the flavors and textures of South Asia.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kPl_kWIqawBvEFHHriXEvaWY0qeZAUki/
Russet Potatoes,Food,Veggies,$0.79 ,/1 Each,"Russets are among America�s favorite potatoes, likely because their starch content makes them so good for both baking and mashing. The Russets you�ll find at Trader Joe�s are definitely delicious, and they also happen to be loaded with potassium and fiber. They�re also practically a perfect size for baking (we recommend giving them a light coat of oil and salt before placing in the oven at 350�F for an hour), at about 4-5 inches and only about 100 calories each. (Disclaimer: if you add loads of butter, sour cream and bacon to your potatoes, we cannot be held responsible for the ultimate calorie count.)
Of course, you don�t have to stick with baking and mashing your Russet Potatoes. You can grate them and make quick hash browns, pur�e them to thicken soups or slice them, toss them in olive oil, and heat them in an air fryer to make healthy �fries.�

Organic Elote Corn Chip Dippers,Food,"Chips, Crackers & Crunchy Bites",$2.69 ,/9.75 Oz,"Throughout Mexico and in cities across the U.S., street vendors sell mouthwatering, well-seasoned corn on the cob known as elote. While the fixins may vary from vendor to vendor, elotes typically come slathered in mayo or a crema-based sauce, rolled in grated cotija or a�ejo cheese, dusted with chili powder, and squirted with lime juice. As anyone who grew up visiting the neighborhood elotero (or making elotes at home) can tell you, it�s a highly craveable combination of flavors that�s sure to leave an impression. It�s left such an impression on us, in fact, that it inspired our exclusive-to-TJ�s snack: Trader Joe�s Organic Elote Corn Chip Dippers.
Elotes are already pretty darn portable (they�re usually served on a stick), but these Organic Elote Corn Chip Dippers take elote-portability to the next level. Now you can enjoy all of that corny, creamy, spiced elote flavor� in a chip! And in a Trader Joe�s Organic Corn Chip Dipper, at that � our original Dippers have been a Customer & Crew favorite for years. With a hint of chipotle, a kick of smoky heat, and a bit of buttermilk-y tang, these Chips have loads of flavor on their own, but they�re perfect for plunging into guacamole or a chunky salsa.

Sweet Potatoes are also an extremely versatile vegetable. They can be baked, roasted, fried, grilled, boiled, mashed or grated. Make sweet potato biscuits, stuffing, soup, pie, casserole. Or you can sweeten them by baking and adding a little butter or maple syrup, and topping them off with some brown sugar. Look for sweet potatoes that are firm and do not have bruises, soft spots or cracks. Store in a cool dry place and do not refrigerate, as cold temperatures alter the flavor and shorten the shelf life.

Our obstacle: cooking gyro (say: �YEE-ro�) meat is no joke.
Just consider the presumed roots of this dish, back to the time of Alexander the Great, when soldiers used their long swords to skewer meat, which they arduously rotated over open fires. Cooking methods may have modern- ized (a bit), but bottom line�it�s an intense process. Luckily, we are in the business of banishing barriers to truly tender, savory meat. Enter: Trader Joe�s Gyro Slices.
Traveling to Chicago�a hotbed of gyro production�we sought out masters of this Mediterranean-style meat. The midwest meat mavins we found, expertly season their fusion of ground beef, breadcrumbs, and lamb, with garlic, oregano, and lemon. Then, they rotate and roast it until it yields. Lastly, they slice it thin, as though on a swords edge, so the meat remains supple, with edges that crisp when heated.
Our Fully Cooked Gyro Slices come ready to heat and dish. While the flatbread wrap is a natural fit (traditional recipe is on the package), it�s also delectable on a Mediterranean pizza or salad.

Starting with a base of ripe, juicy tomatoes, our supplier seasons each batch with a blend of guajillo pur�e, red chili flakes, and garlic, then finishes it with a bit of chipotle pepper powder to add a soft, smoky edge to its steady, satisfying spice.
Just like its namesake pepper, Trader Joe�s Guajillo Salsa makes a remarkably versatile addition to any pantry. It makes a great first course for taco night when enjoyed with tortilla chips, an ideal condiment for tacos, burritos, and fajitas, and even an excellent ingredient in chilis, soups, and queso dips.

As purveyors (and appreciators) of food in all its forms, however, we decided to spend some time contemplating their place on the plate, and when we were done, we found that these crunchy toppers of soups and salads had a tremendous amount of untapped potential. For example, what if, instead of a standard loaf of bread, they were made from a buttery, flaky, luxuriously multi-layered croissant? And what if you added an alluringly aromatic herb, like rosemary, to the mix? Shortly after, Trader Joe�s Rosemary Croissant Croutons were born.
Truly a breakthrough for the medium, these Rosemary Croissant Croutons take everything about a classic crouton to the next level. The buttery, laminated nature of the dough they�re made from results in a remarkably resounding crunch. The satisfyingly savory flavor of the rosemary synergizes spectacularly with everything from creamy Caesar salads to zesty tomato bisques or even hearty, homemade French onion soups.

Our supplier starts with the star of the show: our favorite nutty legume, the chickpea, and blends it into an incredibly creamy base for its supporting acts. A couple spoonfuls of sesame tahini, a splash of oils, garlic and lemon to add tang to the sweet chickpea blend, and salt and cumin round out the pure, organic ingredient list. Don�t allow the unassuming, beige dip basking in its re-sealable bowl fool you, Trader Joe�s Organic Hummus is a classic that is far more than the sum of its parts.

But what makes our traditional hummus different? First, consistency. Mediterranean Hummus is super smooth and creamy, a bit more �whipped� than many of our other hummus choices. The texture of hummus tends to be different depending on where in the world it originates, so it makes sense for us to offer some of that variety in our stores. We�ve also taken the liberty of topping Trader Joe�s Mediterranean Hummus with crunchy pine nuts, and a bright blend of parsley, red bell pepper, and olive oil which creates a distinctive flavor and texture profile we think you�ll really enjoy. Of course, it�s also mighty delicious � then again, this isn�t a difference at all, because we think all of our hummus options (hummi?) are delicious.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U0IDv7dpUFeBcTbQK3s-uY9N8-tTFEwD/

There�s many reasons why: they�re simple to prepare, they�re highly versatile in many culinary situations, and they�re a relatively easy-to-produce source of protein and fiber. But we like to think the main reason is that they�re just naturally delicious.
Take what you�ll find in every can of Trader Joe�s Organic Garbanzo Beans, for instance: small, tender, and toothsome, they have a light, nutty flavor that perfectly complements spices like cumin and coriander. They�re satisfyingly crunchy when roasted, delectably creamy when mashed, there�s a reason these legumes are so legendary. And as if that weren�t enough, they also have the added utility of creating aquafaba when packed in water (as ours are). This handy, vegan egg-replacement can be used to make meringues, cookies, and even mayonnaise. Will the wonders of the Garbanzo Bean ever cease?

The crispy, crunchy, dried garlic and onion creates a delightfully bold, verging-on-umami base, while dried red bell pepper and chili flakes build onto that with complementary smoky, slightly sweet, subtly spicy notes.

Intrigued? We can�t blame you. Luckily, with Trader Joe�s Ground Fermented Black Garlic, it�s never been easier to add this extraordinary flavor to whatever dish strikes your fancy.

As Trader Joe�s Organic Dried & Pitted Deglet Noor Dates ably demonstrate, this milder flavor and toothsome texture make them perfect for all sorts of sweet, savory, or even just snack- based situations.
Organically grown in California, our supplier pits each Date prior to packing, which both makes snacking easier, and leaves a convenient cavity, within which you can stuff cream cheese, blue cheese, chevre, or even bits of bacon or prosciutto. Aside from the implications for appetizers this creates, these Dates are also great for using in baking, incorporating into sauces, or chopping up and mixing into salads.

This happens between every layer, resulting in an almost impossibly delicate and crisp outside, with an interior that is airy and soft. Since butter is the key, we sought out a French supplier who not only has the �prowess,� but who also uses butter in their P�te Feuillet�e, instead of the shortenings you commonly find in other store-bought puff pastry dough.

Better instead to simply enjoy it on anything that could use a bit of savory spice, like pizzas, burgers, potstickers. spring rolls, and more.
Made especially for us by a supplier in Thailand, Trader Joe�s Chili Sesame Oil lends foods a flavor boost that takes place in two phases: first, there�s the baseline of toasty, earthy sesame oil, which gives the brighter flavors of whatever you�re adding it to something to bounce off of. Critically, it also coats the tongue, which lets the heat of the red chilies take hold and begin to spread.

Spatchcocked Lemon Rosemary Chicken,Food,Chicken & Turkey,$5.49 ,/1 Lb,"�Dispatch the cock!� One might alternatively say, �Expedite the chicken!� The theory goes that some hungry Irishman came up with this poultry preparation method that involves the splitting and flattening of a chicken, thus accelerating the rate of cooking, since more of surface area is in touch with the grill or other cooking surface. In short, cooking time is shortened, and the done bird is moister (breasts don�t overcook while the rest of the bird finishes), with lots of nice, evenly crisp skin.
While Spatchcocking isn�t necessarily brain surgery, it does take some extra work in the kitchen, which some feel negates the time you save actually cooking the bird. Trader Joe�s negates this negation by providing a fully Spatchcocked Chicken, ready to grill or roast. Not only is it already �butterflied� for you, it is also pre-seasoned; soaked in a brine with orange and lime juices, and marinated in extra virgin olive oil, vinegar, garlic, rosemary, parsley, and lemon slices.
Remove Trader Joe�s Spatchcocked Lemon Rosemary Chicken from its package (leave the lemon slices in tact and don�t rinse it), and put it on a pre-heated grill skin-side down until it�s well-browned and its internal temperature reaches 165�F on a meat thermometer. Alternately, you can lay it skin-side up in a shallow baking pan and cook at 375�F in your oven for about an hour.

Not to insinuate that it was easy. Not at all. It took months and months of tasting and re-tasting by our panel. (Yes, it�s a messy job, but someone had to do it!) When the chocolate chip cookies finally reached the proper crunchy-chewy ratio (which changed, by the way, depending on how long they�d been frozen), we moved on to the ice cream; it had to be truly transcendent. After a few go-rounds, we landed on the ideal balance of cookie and ice cream. Then, of course, we had to make them even better, so we rolled the sides in mini, semi-sweet chocolate chips.

Our cheese makers, based in Wisconsin, have origins in Valdastico, in Italy�s mountainous, Northeastern Veneto region.

As with most cheeses, we suggest letting Unexpected Cheddar breathe at room temperature for about 30 minutes prior to serving.

Boldly flavored with garlic, Parmesan, and chipotle pepper powder, and featuring toothsome kernels of sweet yellow corn, Trader Joe�s Everything And The Elote Greek Style Yogurt Dip truly lets you have it all.
As it turns out, creamy, lightly tart yogurt and zesty, lightly smoky elote make for a pretty perfect flavor and texture combination � and one that serves equally well with pretty much any kind of scooping vehicle, be it a tortilla chip, cracker, or baby carrot. We also feel obligated to mention how well this Dip works as a spread, especially on sandwiches and wraps that already have a spicy element.

Trader Joe�s Cheddar & Gruyere M�lange, however, is so deeply rooted in the land, that the only way to completely understand it is to go back just that far. What is now northwestern Wisconsin was once barren land covered with glaciers. As the glaciers melted, they left behind a countryside of rolling hills and pasturelands, pasturelands that now serve as the main diet of the cows that produce the milk used to craft Trader Joe�s Cheddar & Gruyere M�lange. So, when you think about it, it all goes back to the glaciers. People talk about terroir in relation to wines: this brief history is testimony to the fact that it can be just as appropriate in describing certain cheeses. The history of Cheddar & Gruyere M�lange at Trader Joe�s isn�t quite as ancient as the glaciers, but we have featured it in our cheese case for more than a decade. (If you�ve ever wept over the loss of a favorite product, you�ll know this is a lifetime in Trader Joe�s years!) It�s a unique combination of Cheddar flavor and Gruyere creaminess; buttery & nutty, with a sweet, mild finish.

Delicately buttery in flavor, this Lite Shredded Mozzarella can be subbed in for any application that calls for regular mozzarella, like pizzas, patty melts, lasagnas or casseroles.

It�s almost always on the cob, and nearly always on a stick. The seasonings vary, but generally include chili powder, cheese, lime or lemon, and a sour cream (crema) based sauce. If you haven�t encountered these street vendors in your travels, you�ve been missing out on something delicious. And even if you have had the opportunity to enjoy elote in its natural environment, you�re not always going to be near a street vendor, right? To satisfy your elote desires at those times, we�ve developed Trader Joe�s Mexican Style Roasted Corn with Cotija Cheese.
For this at-home version of what�s often called street corn, we�ve opted to take the kernels off the cob. We�ve enrobed the corn in a creamy, smoky sauce that melts off as the corn heats � it seems magical, but it�s really just simple thermodynamics. It�s also spiked with lime juice and studded with cilantro, lending additional authenticity. A packet of Cotija cheese is included in each package of Corn � when the corn is heated through and ready to serve, sprinkle the crumbled cheese on top. It�s the ideal finishing touch to this crunchy, sweet, smoky, spicy dish.

They�re then packed in a convenient, easy-open, shelf-stable tin, so they�re ready to eat whenever you�re in need of a good snack, starter, or main course � we particularly like them slightly warmed and served with a cool, creamy sauce, like our Everything But the Bagel Greek Style Yogurt Dip or Avocado Tzatziki.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WW22pZNg0z2nHOR3xC5YW3CIyJ-WJ2cx/
Giant Baked Beans in Tomato Sauce,Food,"Packaged Fish, Meat, Fruit & Veg",$1.99 ,/9.6 Oz,"Residents of the Mediterranean basin�especially countries like Italy and Greece�love their beans. Beans are an integral part of the Mediterranean diet, not only for practical purposes (when religious fasts require non- animal proteins), but also for palatable purposes, since beans can be prepared in so many delicious ways. If you haven�t yet been sold on the pleasures of beans, Trader Joe�s Giant Baked Beans in Tomato Sauce makes a mouthwatering case.
Our Baked Beans in Tomato Sauce is modeled after the traditional Greek dish called gigandes plaki; although, we�ve adjusted the recipe a bit, as we do. Our supplier (in Greece!) takes cannellini beans (in place of traditional, smaller runner beans), and soaks and boils them until they are plump and soft, not to mention Giant (relatively speaking, of course). These big Beans are combined with a Tomato Sauce that includes strips of onion, and finely chopped parsley and dill. It�s seasoned with salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper. This simple, yet delectable, mixture is baked to a rich consistency and finally, canned for you.
Canned? you say. Don�t let the can fool you. This ready-to-eat dish with its smooth, aromatic sauce; cubes of peeled tomatoes; and tender, melt-in-your-mouth beans does not disappoint�even enjoyed at room temperature, straight out of the can. Serve these Giant Beans in a little white bowl as part of a meze spread. Or, warm it up and combine with some wilted spinach and top with Crumbled Feta.

Organic French Baguette,Food,"Loaves, Rolls, Buns",$1.99 ,/11.5 Oz,"Following World War I, French workers rebelled against the upper crust for low wages and poor working conditions. By the early 1920s, the workers� strikes had won important reforms, including strict limitations on long and grueling work hours.
Under the new laws, French bakeries were forbidden to operate between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. Un- fortunately, well-rested bakers also meant that traditional French boules (round loaves) would not have enough time to bake before breakfast. Some historians suspect that this turn of events gave rise to the popularity of the baguette�a long, thin loaf with a shorter baking time�a shoo-in for the new breakfast-bread favorite among the French.
Today, baguettes are a favorite nearly everywhere, all the time. At Trader Joe�s, our conventional baguette has always been the best-selling item in our artisan sections. Now, we have the opportunity to offer a version made with organic, unbleached flour at a highly competitive price. Each 11.5-ounce Organic French Baguette is an amazing $1.99.

But, we did travel to Greece for this Spanakopita, where we engaged some Athenian bakers to make this authentic Greek pastry for us (and for you).
It�s essentially a spinach pie... but the genius is in the details. Our Greek pie-makers start with their own filo dough, machine-cut to size and hand assembled into pies with a filling of three cheeses (feta, mizithra, and a grating cheese), spinach, onion, leek, olive oil, dill, parsley, salt and pepper. The loaded disc is then pre-cut into wedges that will puff up when you bake them at home. Once you do bake this pie (in the provided ovenable tray at 350�F for about a half-hour), you�ll have yourself a crisp, buttery pastry with a delectable filling.

We thought a summer pasta sounded sensational and wanted our Girasloli to capture the radiance and warmth of its namesake. We turned to our revered Italian pasta makers for a recipe. Committed to preserving regional culinary traditions, they presented us with a fine Ricotta & Lemon Zest Pasta in the style of Sicily, using real Sicilian lemons.
It starts with classic, fresh, Italian pasta, made with only three ingredients: soft wheat flour, durum wheat semolina and egg. Tender and rich, the pasta glows golden, courtesy of the egg. Rolled thin and custom cut to resemble a sunflower, it is then filled with fresh ricotta, naturally creamy and slightly sweet, that is mixed with lemon zest and balanced with butter, bread crumbs and salt. The bite captures a sunny, summer day in Sicily.
While all of the elements are essential, the lemons paint the picture. Grown in the volcanic soil around Mount Etna, the authentic Sicilian lemons have a bright acidity and distinct sweetness.

Trader Joe's Cauliflower Pizza Crusts are another way to prove this theorem. Like our Cauliflower Thins, our Cauliflower Pizza Crusts are made of similar ingredients (by the same supplier, in fact).

The benefits to buying already-marinated meat? One, you�d have to plan way ahead to achieve this level of flavor infusion on your own. Two, because we�ve done the trimming and cutting, there�s no waste when you make it for your family. And three, it cooks so fast you�ll be dining in minutes.
Cook it quickly and slice it for tacos, burritos, quesadillas, or an impressive center-of-the-plate presentation with all the traditional accompaniments of Mexican cuisine � some Organic Salsa, guacamole, and shredded cheese, perhaps?

Trader Joe�s All Natural Bone-In Skin-On Chicken Thighs fit neatly into this category.
These Thighs come from chickens that are raised without the use of antibiotics (ever), and, per federal regulations, are not given added hormones. They�re vegetarian fed and minimally processed. Importantly, they are darn-near-perfect for grilling. Thigh meat is always incredibly flavorful, and that robust flavor is even more pronounced when the skin and bones are left intact. And even more pronounced if you slather them in Organic Sweet & Spicy Pineapple BBQ Sauce or another saucy favorite while you�re grilling. Not grilling? Not a problem! You can bake them in your conventional oven � we like to sear them on the stovetop in a cast iron skillet first, to get a good crisp on the skin � to equally delicious results.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FySGyCpGnGhuGWtx8-zVCcp2u2EXQx1q/

Black and white sesame seeds, poppy seeds, and sea salt combine with the pungent flavors of garlic and onion to complement these nuts. And complement is what it does, rather than overwhelm. You still get the robust flavor of both the almonds and cashews, along with the signature savory of the seasoning, along with six grams of protein per quarter-cup serving.

Nowadays, even dishes that are more or less defined by their meatiness are available in vegan form, without sacrificing any of their signature texture or savory flavor. Take Trader Joe�s Vegan Pasta Bolognese, for example. Traditionally, the heartiness of rag� alla bolognese comes from its base of slow-braised beef, pork, or veal, but by using a combination of perfectly-textured wheat protein and umami-rich mushrooms, our Vegan Pasta Bolognese evokes that typically non-vegan profile in a decidedly vegan way, all packaged together in one convenient, easy-to-prepare, frozen meal.
Each bowl of Trader Joe�s Vegan Pasta Bolognese comes with a bed of toothsome, tube-shaped pasta made from red lentils, which our supplier then tops with a ragu made with tomato, carrot, onion, and garlic, in addition to the previously mentioned mushrooms and wheat protein. All together, they create a supremely satisfying pasta dish that takes only a few minutes in the microwave to heat up, and provides an impressive amount of protein per one-bowl serving. Equally suited for vegans and non-vegans, keep one in your freezer for an easy, last-minute dinner option, or bring it as a work lunch for meatless Mondays.

The best way for us to describe Trader Joe�s Crispy Jalape�o Pieces is: Crispy Onion Pieces, but with jalape�os instead of onions. That�s really it.

For even happier faces, we choose deli meats without added preservatives like nitrites or nitrates.
And for the happiest faces of all, we look for organic deli meats made from turkeys that haven't been treated with hormones (per federal regulations) or antibiotics - ever. Trader Joe's Organic Oven Roasted Turkey Breast fits into all these categories, so please forgive us if we can't seem to wipe the smiles from our faces.

No Sugar Dry Rubbed Uncured Bacon,Food,"Beef, Pork & Lamb",$4.99 ,/8 Oz,"As delicious as bacon can be (and believe us, we consider ourselves the foremost experts on how delicious bacon can be), a typical strip of cured bacon isn't always the best choice for folks who are watching their sugar or sodium intake. But, of course, as intrepid adventurers on the culinary seas (when not performing our bacon deliciosity expert roles, that is), we felt it was our duty to bridge that gap. That's why we've developed Trader Joe's No Sugar Dry Rubbed Uncured Bacon, because cutting back on sugar and salt shouldn't mean you miss out on bacon's savory splendor.
Our supplier starts with pork that was raised crate free, completely vegetarian fed, and strictly without the use of antibiotics or hormones, then covers it in a dry rub composed of sea salt and spices like fenugreek, white pepper, and allspice-and, notably, no sugar. Once the dry rub has had time to set in, the bacon is then slow smoked over a blend of smoldering natural hardwood for seven to eight hours.
The result is a superbly spiced, smoky bacon that crisps and crackles in your skillet just as bacon should, but without any of the sugar, and about 37% less sodium than the USDA standard. For those trying to cut their carbs while still enjoying a hearty breakfast, this one's for you-each strip of our No Sugar Dry Rubbed Uncured Bacon boasts an average zero grams of carbohydrates, and four grams of protein.
Without the extra sugar, feel free to enjoy this bacon to its full potential, be it diced, fried, and mixed in with Brussels sprouts, atop a veggie wrapped hamburger, or just on its own for a delightfully traditional breakfast (or snack).",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p6UH-PNt3bbVyarda8tk313rT8tH59ec/

With science as our guide, we can say with certainty that after sampling a trunk-ful, an elephant would truly never forget Trader Joe's Bamba Peanut Snacks.
Small and unassuming (much like peanuts themselves), Bamba Peanut Snacks are light, crunchy, and positively bursting with rich, peanut flavor. It's a snack unlike any other, and once you give them a try, even non-elephant types like yourself are sure to have Bamba on the brain.
Made for us in Israel, where Bamba is far and away the best-selling snack in the country, Trader Joe's Bamba Peanut Snacks contain just four, simple ingredients: corn grits, peanut paste, palm oil, and salt. First, the corn grits are ""popped"" under high pressure, turning them into long rope-like lines of white, puffed, unflavored ""Bamba."" Next, the Bamba is cut into peanut-sized nuggets and air-baked for 20 seconds in a drying chamber, which gives it an even crispier texture.
Finally, the Bamba is moved into large, rotating drums, where they are coated with hot, liquid peanut butter (made from peanut paste, palm oil, and salt). The resulting snack is crunchy, airy, peanutty and highly craveable-kind of like a cheese puff without the cheese.
Not only is Bamba is tricky to find in general (most U.S. grocers don't carry the stuff), it's darn near impossible to find it at a price better than ours. Pass the Bamba, please...",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XBOiYFMfKRf5_18pv00_O9Ipo_979_kx/

Chile Spiced Pineapple,Food,"Nuts, Dried Fruits, Seeds",$3.99 ,/6 Oz,"As far as flavor combinations go, it's hard to beat sweet and spicy. There's a distinct dynamism to it, where the more you crank up the sweetness and the spiciness, the more interesting the flavor profile becomes. In the case of Trader Joe's Chile Spiced Pineapple, for example, we've taken something super sweet and succulent (dried rings of pineapple from Ghana) and paired it up with something truly spicy (a bold chili powder blend with cayenne and traditional chamoy powder), plus a little extra cane sugar and salt to make a snack that hits that special mix of sweet and heat that leaves you craving more with every bite.
Great for bringing along on road trips, keeping on hand at work, or simply enjoying at home, our Chile Spiced Pineapple is great for practically any snacking occasion.

Vegan Bolognese Style Pasta Sauce,Food,"BBQ, Pasta, Simmer",$3.49 ,/16 Oz,"Though we might think of it as a rather timeless classic, bolognese pasta sauce is a relatively recent invention. First described in print in the late 1800s, rag� alla bolognese started as a descendent of French rago�t, a hearty, meat-based stew. Since then, there�s never really been one definitive recipe for a bolognese sauce � many iterations don�t even include tomatoes � other than a commonality of braised beef, veal, or pork as the center of the dish. In other words, out of reach for non-carnivores. Until today, that is: Trader Joe�s Vegan Bolognese Style Pasta Sauce evokes all the savory splendor of a perfectly seasoned bolognese, but does so with tender crumbles made of pea protein, resulting in a sauce with as much protein as its meat-based cousins.
Made with tomatoes imported from Italy, our Vegan Bolognese is rich and satisfying to vegans and non- vegans alike with lightly herbaceous and peppery notes. Like our other jarred pasta sauces, preparation is as simple as warming on the stovetop until heated through, then mixing with freshly cooked and drained pasta. While spaghetti is a popular pairing choice outside of Italy, within Bologna itself, it's more often made with flatter, broader noodles like pappardelle, or tube shapes like macaroni or rigatoni, both of which complement its thicker, meatier texture.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/17A_UCyw7ENuCw1WZ62KepkMWxfbUuXhX/

And it's really just something you're going to want to put on everything.
To create this Umami Seasoning Blend, we began with salt, and used a flavor base of porcini and white button mushrooms � earthy mushroom flavor really is the cornerstone of umami, which is why we named it Mushroom & Company. The ingredient list also includes onion, mustard seed, red & black pepper, and thyme. If you follow an eating plan like Paleo or Whole 30, this type of seasoning is a staple.

This recipe was dreamed up by one of our Buyers, who wanted to introduce a unique flavor profile to our selection of complete salad kits. A blend of shredded rainbow carrots, broccoli stalks, green cabbage, and kale comprises the ""slaw"" part of this Slaw.
But it's the good stuff-the ingredients from which the Slaw got its name-that take this from an ordinary slaw into something profoundly delicious. Pepitas, chopped sun-dried apricots, and a creamy tahini orange dressing make this truly one-of-a-kind.
Such a vibrant Slaw Kit allows for quick-and tasty-weekday meal prep. It's as easy as adding a piece of grilled salmon, Grilled Chicken Strips, or Falafel. Serve it as a side dish to a larger meal, or toss a crunchy addition into sandwiches, wraps, or Tahini, Pepita & Apricot Slawcos.

It's is a new thing for cornbread, but we're pretty sure it'll only take one bite for you to be lying on your (real) pillow, dreaming of Crisps.
To make these Cornbread Crisps, we first make cornbread. Yes, the traditional, fluffy, flavorful cornbread. We use cornmeal, sunflower oil, and sugar for this step. Then, the cornbread is flattened and cut into small diamond shapes. Into the oven they go, and out come crunchy bites of cornbread. A touch of sea salt creates that perfect sweet-salty flavor balance that results in Crisps you won't want to put down.
Our Cornbread Crisps pair wonderfully anywhere you might want traditional cornbread. Crumble into bowls of soup. Trader Joe's Butternut Squash, Turkey Chili, Black Bean, or Tomato Feta, perhaps?

Organic Caesar Salad Kit,Food,"Salads, Soups & Sides",$4.99 ,/12 Oz,"You may be familiar with Caesar Salad's origin story; back in 1924, or so the story goes, chef Caesar Cardini was about to close his restaurant in Tijuana, Mexico for the night when a hungry customer asked for a salad. Nearly out of ingredients, Caesar whipped together what he had, and the now-classic Caesar Salad was born.
As we quickly approach the Caesar Salad's 100th anniversary (where has the time gone?), the question is raised: how does one properly render tribute to such a sovereign of salads? How does one hail such a monarch of mixed greens? We came, we saw, we stepped up our game with Trader Joe's Organic Caesar Salad Kit.
It's the classic crunchy, creamy, garlicky, and (most importantly) delicious Caesar Salad you know and love, except this time, it's all organic. In other words, each bag contains crisp, fresh-chopped leaves of organic Roamine lettuce, tasty shreds of organic parmesan cheese, splendidly seasoned organic croutons, and a rich, peppery salad dressing made entirely with organic ingredients. All you have to do is make like chef Caesar and mix them all together, and your conquest of dinner is complete.
Like a certain other Caesar we can think of, you may be surprised at just how protean this salad can be-no need to confine it to just a side. Simply add some grilled steak, chicken, or shrimp, and you have a full-fledged entr�e.

Focaccia Bread with Roasted Tomato & Parmesan,Food,Tortillas & Flatbreads,$4.49 ,/14 Oz,"Let's take a moment to focus on Focaccia - which, as it turns out, is a pretty etymologically appropriate thing to do! The Italian word focaccia is derived from the original Latin word focus, which referred to the central hearth of a home, where the majority of a family's cooking was done.
Indeed, by definition, focaccia (or panis focacius, as the Romans called it) was associated with the warmth and comfort of home from the very start. In that same tradition, we're setting our focus on the warmth and comfort of this soft, savory bread with Trader Joe's Focaccia Bread with Roasted Tomato & Parmesan.
Harkening back to its Ancient Roman roots, Trader Joe's Focaccia Bread is baked on a heated tile inside of a blazing hot, stone hearth oven. These conditions allow the bread to form the crisp, light crust and soft, airy crumb texture that focaccia is famous for.
Our supplier also upholds an equally important (and delicious) tradition by topping each loaf with extra virgin olive oil, aromatic herbs, flavorful roasted tomatoes, and a generous dusting of finely-grated Parmesan cheese. Put together, each bite is a marvelous mix of iconic Italian flavors, perfect for serving alongside pasta, dipping into a mixture of olive oil and TJ's Balsamic Vinegar of Modena, or slicing and lightly toasting for use in sandwiches.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EcIzR-yqyGCM-lTSWJxXuid2a5FEgaxH/

Pumpkin seeds, also known as pepitas, are an exceptionally crunchy, slightly nutty, deliciously flavorful treat that can bring a serious savory factor to pretty much anything they're added to, be it a pesto sauce, trail mix, or Trader Joe's Pepita Salsa.
By combining the bright, zesty tomato and pepper flavors of a traditional chunky salsa with the texture and nuttiness of finely chopped pepitas, our Pepita Salsa has created a savory synthesis of seed and spice. Not only do the pepitas add a nice thickness to the salsa's body, making it even easier to scoop up with a tortilla or corn chip, but their hearty, earthy flavor expertly balances the acidity of the tomatoes and vinegar.
On top of that, each bite of Pepita Salsa also carries the delicate sweet heat of pur�ed bell pepper and chipotle spices, making this one seriously satisfying salsa.
Please join us in welcoming Trader Joe's Pepita Salsa to our legendary family of pumpkin products.

Wouldn't a feta-less Greek salad be reduced to a salad without a country? Luckily, we don't have to deal in such alarming hypotheticals, because we've got Trader Joe's Israeli Feta at the ready.
Since feta has such a long and storied history (records show that feta and feta-like cheeses have been eaten in the Mediterranean region for thousands of years, and even garnered a mention in Homer's Odyssey), we knew we needed a supplier who would respect that history. That's why we reached out to a 4th generation cheesemaker in Israel, whose family has been in the dairy business for over a century. Their feta speaks for itself: creamy, crumbly, and toothsome, with a wonderfully soft texture and a mild, tart tang - exactly how a feta ought to be.
While we recommend using this Israeli Feta in all the ways you normally would for a delicious Mediterranean fetas, we also strongly encourage you to enjoy it as a table cheese, part of a cheese plate or roasted...

The sauce is certainly Chunky, including whole, peeled, San Marzano tomatoes, with additional diced tomatoes. There are also red bell peppers in the mix. And it's Spicy, with heat that comes from harissa, including spices such as paprika, cumin, garlic, cayenne, black pepper, and coriander.
Although we call it a Pasta Sauce, there is so much more you can do with the contents of this jar. It's perfect as a ready-made base for Shakshuka. Or, you can use it for a pizza sauce with extra pizazz. Make it your base for soups or stews, such as Chicken Cacciatore. However you use it, you'll find our Spicy Chunky Tomato & Pepper Pasta Sauce is a handy helper for creating all kinds of chunky, spicy, flavorful meals!",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-H3rE12US7GynEC9iL_ADpJ1KhpeZY04/
Creamy Cauliflower Jalape�o Dip,Food,Dip/Spread,$3.49 ,/10 Oz,"When we sampled a creamy cauliflower-based dip on a visit to one of our suppliers, we knew it had serious potential. Just the fact that it had cauliflower was already a win! However, we felt that overall the dip wasn't very... shall we say, virtuous?
We got to work with the dip maker and we were not only able to move cauliflower to the top of the ingredient deck, we were also able to tweak the other ingredients to make what was to become our version, Trader Joe's Creamy Cauliflower Jalape�o Dip, just a little more nutritionally wholesome.
With cauliflower as the base, this dip also includes cream cheese, light cream, ricotta, and Parmesan for a truly Creamy feel. We also added a wee touch of Jalape�o peppers for some extra, contrasting flavor. Bottom line? This Dip eats more indulgent than it actually is, with just 40 calories per serving (2 Tbsp.).",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fBwa378sJtoOOJkxsQFJZ5HS7qZJW3-f/

Irresistible is exactly how we'll describe Trader Joe's Garlic & Onion Pistachios.

To that end, why shouldn't a cereal bar provide the same protein-packed pick-me-up of a protein bar? And while we're on the subject, why shouldn't we combine them into one convenient, tasty treat?
At Trader Joe's, we don't just ask the tough questions, we answer them. Today, our answer comes in the form of Trader Joe's Chewy Chocolate & Peanut Butter Protein Bars, a delightfully delicious and properly proteinaceous cereal bar made from a mix of peanuts, soy protein, and brown rice protein that's flavored with the classic sweet-savory combo of dark chocolate and peanut butter. Each bite of one of our Chewy Chocolate & Peanut Butter Protein Bars starts out with the familiar soft texture of a granola or cereal bar, which gives way to the crunch of the peanuts and crispy soy, which itself turns to satisfying, mouth-filling chewiness. Add to that its almost candy-like peanut butter & chocolate profile and whopping 10 grams of protein per serving, and you've got a bar as utilitarian as it is delicious.

Trader Joe's Peanut Udon Noodle Salad brings this particular pasta to a chilled application, rich in texture and robust in flavor.
Authentic udon noodles made with organic wheat flour are boiled and drained, then mixed with fresh carrot matchsticks. The soft & chewy vs. crisp & crunchy contrast is crave-able; the crunch factor is amped up with the addition of green and red cabbage, red bell peppers, and dry roasted peanuts. The more aromatic flavors of diced green onion and cilantro enhance the profile, to be sure, but it's the peanut-ginger dressing that Thai-s it all together. (Yes, we did that.) Peanut butter, soy sauce, and rice vinegar make up the dressing base; ginger pur�e, lemon grass, garlic, lime juice, dried red chili peppers, basil, ground Thai lime leaf, spearmint, and cayenne pepper give it personality galore.
This vegan salad is a great grab-n-go lunch, though the package contains about two-and-a-half servings. It also makes a wonderful fresh side dish for chicken skewers.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JyR-gA_72S9_rFx8BxrQnVzLjwN_5G3U/
Organic Thick & Chunky Salsa,Food,Salsa & Hot Sauce,$2.99 ,/16 Oz,"The name of Trader Joe's Organic Thick & Chunky Salsa does aptly communicate its texture, but what it doesn't convey is the devoted following it's already garnered amongst our tasting panel. One reason for this devotion is its USDA-certified organic status; up until now, TJ's Organic Tomatillo & Roasted Yellow Chili Salsa has been our lone shelf-stable organic salsa offering.
Another reason-the most important reason-is its sheer deliciousness. Made with big chunks of organic diced tomatoes, organic tomato paste, organic onions, and organic jalape�os, then spiced with organic cayenne pepper and organic dehydrated garlic, Trader Joe's Organic Thick & Chunky Salsa is fresh and flavorful, packing just the right amount of medium-level heat.
And, boy, is this Salsa versatile. Sure, you can use it as you would any other-in burritos, tacos, and quesadillas, with tortilla chips, etc. But you can also use it in less expected ways. Spoon it atop baked chicken or fish. Pour a few jars into a slow cooker with TJ's Bone-In Skin-On Chicken Thighs and vegetables. Use it as the sauce on a tasty Mexican-inspired pizza.

Dark Chocolate Sunflower Seed Butter Cups,Food,Candies & Cookies,$0.99 ,/1.4 Oz,"Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups include a rich, dark chocolate shell encasing creamy, salty peanut butter-what's not to love about that?
Well, if you're allergic to peanuts, plenty! It was this gap in salty, nutty-flavored, chocolatey candy offerings for the peanut-averse that inspired our product developer to create Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Sunflower Seed Butter Cups, the newest addition to our candy set.
The Cups themselves are formed with rich, fair trade Dark Chocolate, and measure about two inches in diameter. Encased in each Cup is a thick layer of Sunflower Seed Butter, which has been salted and sweetened just enough to avoid the bitterness that sometimes accompanies plain sunflower seed butter.
This magical merger of dark chocolate and salty seed butter masterfully mimics the craveable creaminess of a peanut butter cup, without peanuts! And since we're talking about what you won't find in these cups, gluten, dairy, soy, and tree nuts are all absent from the ingredient deck as well. While the nut-free ingredient deck makes these Cups a fantastic addition to a school lunch box, make no mistake-it was their sweet-salty, creamy, can't-stop-eating-them profile that truly won hearts (and stomachs) during our tasting panel.
Each package contains two generously-sized Dark Chocolate Sunflower Seed Butter Cups, one for you and one for a friend (whether you share the second Cup or not is entirely up to you, of course).",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oFqcojPPxFEO59lJ3VeN9ObG772wutsS/
Jerk-Style Plantain Chips,Food,"Chips, Crackers & Crunchy Bites",$1.99 ,/6 Oz,"While there's a fair bit of contention as to the precise origins of jerk cooking (some argue that it was invented by the indigenous Taino and Arawak peoples of Jamaica, while others assert that escaped slaves created the cuisine after establishing their own communities on the island), one thing is indisputable: jerk seasoning is savory, spicy, and certifiably sensational.
Based primarily on the flavors of allspice and hot red peppers, jerk seasoning is traditionally used on milder-flavored proteins like chicken or pork, but we find that it works equally well as a snack-enhancer. Need proof? Look no further than Trader Joe's Jerk-Style Plantain Chips.
Drawing inspiration from classic Jamaican cooking, our Jerk-Style Plantain Chips pair the satisfying crunch of a plantain chip with the multitude of flavors of jerk seasoning. Each individual Chip is covered in a generous dusting of jerk cooking-inspired herbs and spices, including allspice, garlic powder, cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg, and ginger extract.
What you'll likely notice above all other flavors, however, is the increasing heat of spicy red chili pepper powder. As you snack, the spice builds steadily (but not altogether overwhelmingly) to an exhilarating crescendo of heat, making it a perfect treat for the real spice fans out there (you know who you are.)",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UTB2YlvBTyunI6XbeLS-C_IWRfF2W5cU/

The chips are made from a combination of dried potatoes, corn meal, and rice flour and formed into perfectly mouth-shaped Crisps. Actually, a more apt description would be ""saddle-shaped"" Crisps, hence the name we've chosen for these choice chips.

We drew inspiration from this curiously crunchy treat to create our newest snack creation. Feel free to call them what you like - we call them Trader Joe's Plantain Crisps.
To make each Crisp, our supplier takes slices of green plantains (of the pl�tanos machos variety, to be specific), cooks them in oil, smashes them flat until they're around two to three inches in diameter, then cooks them again. These last two steps are where we depart most from tradition - our Crisps are much thinner than a typical tostone, and fried for a little longer, so that they're even crunchier, more chip-like, and ready to scoop up your favorite guacamole or dip.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wYJ88EcuSXIBClm-UAn42dWladLgeYP5/

More importantly, you can taste their dedication to tradition with every saucy, savory, exquisitely zesty bite.
Preparation couldn't be simpler: with either a microwave and a microwave safe dish, or a bit of water, olive oil, and a pan on the stovetop, you can go from frozen to fresh, steamy pasta in mere minutes. All that's left to do after that is garnish it with some Parmesan, perhaps a few freshly-torn basil leaves, and pair it with a chilled glass of Pinot Grigio.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jB8dvpWd0xh9_brC_BVTdgRatMowmzoK/

Warm, savory, and filled with satisfyingly silky textures, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more comforting comfort food than pho (pronounced fuh, for the record). Since its creation in late 19th century Vietnam, pho has turned into a certified foodie phenomenon, and a staple of noodle shop menus the world over.

Blueberry muffins are a true classic of the muffin category, and Trader Joe's Blueberry Muffins play to every one of the genre's strengths: a crumbly, cakey texture, delightful hints of lemon zest, and, of course, an abundance of wild and cultivated blueberries in each bite. While they're perfectly delicious when enjoyed as a quick, on-the-go breakfast snack or brunch side, we contend that they truly excel when heated up a bit in the toaster oven or microwave - the aromatics of warm blueberries alone are well worth the price of admission.

For example, Nashville is known for country music. For Scotland, it's whisky. And for salami, Parma is where it's at-especially when ""it"" is Trader Joe's Uncured Salame di Parma Mild Salami.
Imported from Parma, Italy, this Uncured Salame is sliced and packaged in the U.S.A. to ensure the freshest product possible. But before it makes its way across the Atlantic, the pork is slowly aged in the air of the Italian Apennine Mountains, which creates an ideal climate for drying and aging meat. This results in a well-balanced, mild Salame, with subtle notes of spice and a clean, satisfyingly meaty flavor. And there are no nitrates or nitrites added, except for those naturally occurring in celery juice and sea salt.
For an Italian snack trifecta, pair this Salame with a few other things Italy is known for: freshly sliced Trader Joes's Parmigiano Reggiano and a bottle of Chianti. Its mild flavor makes it a must-have when putting together a cheese plate. Roll up a slice and slide it on a toothpick with pickled vegetables for an easy, party-worthy appetizer. Because it's packed in an easy open tray and thinly sliced, this Salame must remain refrigerated until you're ready to enjoy.

If you're looking to lessen the nutritional impact that accompanies said side dish, however, it can be tough to find a creamy replacement that stands up to the might of the mashed potato on a dinner plate. Enter Trader Joe's Mashed Cauliflower.
To give this dish dimension, our supplier utilizes not one, but two different cuts of cauliflower-in fact, cauliflower accounts for more than 70% of the recipe! Blanched cauliflower bits are simmered with skim milk, half & half and butter for creaminess, and then rice flour, garlic, salt and pepper are added to create a velvety pur�e.
Finally, larger chunks of cauliflower florets are added to give this Mash toothsome texture. When the mixture has cooled, it's punctiliously portioned into petite pucks, so you can prepare what you need when you need it, and save the rest for later. Mashtastic!
Serve Mashed Cauliflower alongside a hot-off-the-grill, bone-in ribeye steak. Pair it with Green Jackfruit simmered in Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce.

And with that in mind, we've created a new seasoning salt to celebrate these flavorful alliums: Trader Joe's Onion Salt.
It may be called Onion Salt, but it has a few other alliums that, in our opinion, make this seasoning truly special. Granulated onion makes up the majority of this spice, but there's also granulated garlic, minced onion, salt, green onion, and dried chives.
Those last few ingredients give the spice its eye-catching green color and an extra kick of flavor. Most other onion salts on the market don't pack so many alliums in, making ours truly unique.

In addition to using it in place of regular salt when you're looking for a bit of extra onion-y flavor, try any one of the following: Shake on top of your morning eggs.

Believing that plantain popularity has not quite peaked, we decided to provide another option - this time, on the sweeter side. Introducing Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Drizzled Plantain Chips!
It's really not rocket science. We've simply taken those same, round, bite-size pieces of plantain and cooked them in sunflower oil, as before. The difference here is that instead of something savory, we've added a delicious drizzle of dark chocolate. Of course, we counter-balance the sweet with just the right amount of sea salt sprinkled on each Chip.

When we call our new Extra Hot Habanero Ghost Pepper Salsa extra hot, though, we mean it. In this case, there is no hyperbole or exaggeration. It is hot-and also delicious.
Ghost chili peppers are some of the spiciest chilies around. Naturally, we turned to these to heat up our spiciest salsa to date-but a little bit goes a long way. The small-but-mighty amount of smoked ghost pepper powder we use is combined with vine-ripened tomatoes, fresh onion, cilantro, habanero peppers, and roasted red bell and poblano peppers. The result? A spicy Salsa that's full of flavor and has that perfect Mexican restaurant-style consistency: not too chunky, and perfectly scoopable.
Enjoying the spiciness of this Salsa is as easy as scooping it up with some Trader Joes's Tortilla Chips. Of course, there are about a million other uses (now that's hyperbole).

But as time went by, we realized that it could be even better. So, with our classic & wildly popular Diner Mac 'n Cheese as her inspiration, our Buyer set out to create the perfect Gluten Free Mac & Cheese once and for all-and the rest is history. Or, shall we say, cheesetory.
Unlike our previous, two-cheese incarnation, Trader Joe's Gluten Free Mac & Cheese is now made with the exact same four-cheese blend you'll find in our beloved Diner Mac-Cheddar, Swiss, Havarti, & Gouda, all made with milk from cows not treated with rBST. We also add milk & a house-made, gluten free b�chamel to this four-cheese blend, which makes for a comforting creation that's extra thick & creamy.
And lest we miss the mac for the cheese (as they say), we've taken equally great care in selecting the perfect pasta: a corkscrew-shaped Rotini made with a blend of corn, rice, lentil, & quinoa flours.

Thankfully times have changed, and folks looking to avoid a meat-based meal (on Monday, or any other day) have more options out there, with more flavor than ever before. Options like Trader Joe's Chipotle Vegetable Quesadillas.
Made for us in sunny southern California, our Chipotle Vegetable Quesadillas are the answer to your lunch cravings, dinner yearnings or late night hunger pangs. Our supplier starts with a hand-stretched flour tortilla, and packs it with gooey Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses.
They then take dried, smoked jalape�os and marinate them in a seasoned sauce of garlic and tomato-this is what puts the ""chipotle"" in Chipotle Vegetable Quesadilla. Savory onions, black beans and sweet corn are folded into the smoky, spiced sauce, and the mixture is then layered into the cheesy tortilla, which is then pressed to deliciousness-without a handful of broccoli or veggie patty in sight!
These Quesadillas cook up beautifully in the microwave; if you go the stove or oven prep route, you'll end up with crispy tortilla edges that provide a pleasant counterpoint to the smoky cheesiness within.

We've carried a fat-free version of this classic cheese for quite some time, but as palates and preferences are wont to change when it comes to food trends, we felt the existing product could use a refresh of sorts. Without further adieu, we're pleased to welcome Trader Joe's Part Skim Ricotta Cheese to our cheese case.
To find a Part Skim Ricotta Cheese aligned with Trader Joe's standards (tastes excellent, offers amazing value, and made with milk from cows not treated with rBST), our product developer went to Wisconsin, a state that's second to none when it comes to cheese-making capability. The cheese monger combines pasteurized whey, cream, milk, vinegar and a touch of salt to produce a cheese that's rich, creamy and slightly grainy in texture, with a fresh, slightly sweet flavor.
The clean, versatile flavor of Part Skim Ricotta Cheese leaves it open to all sorts of culinary interpretation. Enjoy it with a few cracks of salt & pepper, olive oil and chopped fresh herbs.

Now, when you use breakfast ingredients instead of beans and cheese, it's a real game-changer (or breakfast-changer).
Our Trader Joe's Chicken Sausage Breakfast Burrito aptly contains all the important breakfast ingredients necessary to deem this breakfast-worthy. We went after tradition: chicken sausage flavored with sage and thyme, scrambled eggs, potatoes, saut�ed onions, and white cheddar cheese live inside a chewy flour tortilla. The proportions are just right, so you'll get a little bit of everything in each bite. And, though it is a Breakfast Burrito, you don't have to restrict the time of day in which you enjoy it-it's always delicious.
Maybe the best part about this Breakfast Burrito (after the Burrito itself, of course) is the endless condiment possibilities that lay before you.

In the jar is a one-of-a-kind mix of almonds, cashews, walnuts, Brazil nuts, hazelnuts, and pecans, with just a bit of sea salt to round out the flavors. The nuts are dry roasted, then ground together into creamy bliss. Spread on sandwiches, celery sticks, or used in a grilled nut butter & banana sandwich, you'll love the rich, nutty nature of this Butter.

Organic Coconut Aminos Seasoning Sauce,Food,Dressing & Seasoning,$2.99 ,/8.5 Fl Oz,"The versatility of the Cocos nucifera (the coconut tree) cannot be overstated. It produces an impressive number of coconut-based products with varied, but important, uses: coconut meat and coconut milk for cooking, coconut water for hydration, coconut sugar for baking... impressive, indeed.
Another impressive, lesser known (but not for long) member of the coconut clan is the sap of the coconut blossom. When fermented, this sap forms a savory, amino-rich sauce with a whole host of uses. With the coconut craze still going strong, we felt it was the right time to introduce Trader Joe's Organic Coconut Aminos Seasoning Sauce to our clan of coconut products.
Made in Sri Lanka, organic coconut sap is hand-harvested and fermented, then boiled to create an amino-rich sauce-13 amino acids, to be exact. A touch of sea salt provides a balanced mineral quality. Flavor-wise, coconut does not come to mind: Organic Coconut Aminos can be likened to soy sauce, though not quite as salty, and with a touch of sweetness.
There are no soy ingredients in this product, which makes it an often-called-for flavoring in paleo recipes. And at 300mg of sodium per tablespoon (vs. 920mg in the leading soy sauce brand), this gluten-free, (pareve) Sauce is a great option for those looking to reduce their sodium intake.
Use this Seasoning Sauce as a less-salty stand-in for tamari or soy sauce. Deepen the flavor of saut�ed veggies or fried rice. Blend it with garlic, lemon juice and honey for a simple salmon marinade. Add it to salad dressing or serve with sushi.

It's savory, tangy, and spicy-but not so spicy that you'd have any qualms about dousing your food in it-and there's no added sugar, to boot!
We tried to hint at this in the beginning, but just because it's called Taco Sauce doesn't mean you have to use this stuff exclusively on tacos. In reality, you might want to use it on everything.

Since minestra, the root of Minestrone, means ""to serve"" in Italian, it's only fitting that this soup be served-and served well!

Preparation is a breeze: simply remove your Riced Cauliflower Bowl from its box, cut a one-inch slit in the film covering the bowl, microwave for three minutes, then remove the film, mix it together, and microwave for an additional two or three minutes.

Everything But The Elote Seasoning Blend,Food,Spices,$1.99 ,/2.3 Oz,"Throughout Mexico and in cities across the U.S., street vendors sell mouthwatering, well-seasoned corn on the cob known as Elote. While the fixins may vary some from vendor to vendor, elote typically comes slathered in mayo or crema, rolled in grated Parmesan or cotija cheese, dusted with chili powder, and squirted with lime juice. As anyone who grew up visiting the neighborhood elotero or making elote at home can tell you, it's a highly crave-able combination of flavors that leaves a lifelong impression.
Elotes are already pretty darn portable (they're usually served on sticks), but Trader Joe's Everything But the Elote Seasoning Blend takes it a step further, each jar containing everything you might find on elote�chile pepper, Parmesan cheese, chipotle powder, cumin, dried cilantro, sea salt, etc.�minus the corn itself. (We also add some corn flour & cane sugar, so there's really no mistaking what it's meant to mimic.) We put together a few recipes if you need elote inspiration because We Like It.

Cuban Style Citrusy Garlic Seasoning Blend,Food,Spices,$1.99 ,/2.25 Oz,"Inspired by all the marvelous mojo-marinated meat we've enjoyed over the years, Trader Joe's Cuban Style Citrusy Garlic Seasoning Blend is, as its name would suggest, traditionally tangy, good-n-garlicky, and downright delicious. We first saw these classic Cuban flavors in convenient seasoning form at a Miami mini-market, and we knew we had to make one of our own.
Trader Joe's Cuban Style Citrusy Garlic Seasoning Blend is essentially a blend of garlic, lime oil, lime juice, onion powder, salt, and red pepper-plus bay leaves, coriander, cumin, cilantro, black pepper, oregano, cilantro, basil, lemon oil, marjoram, and parsley to round it out. It's all the essential flavors you'd find in common Cuban cuisine, packaged in one little jar!
Rub onto poultry, meat, or fish; sprinkle on veggies or tofu; add it to beans, rice, or try your hand at this marinade recipe for a tangy twist on a roast pork tenderloin.

Vegan Caesar Dressing,Food,Dressing & Seasoning,$3.99 ,/11 Fl Oz,"Since its popularization in the mid-20th century, the Caesar salad has remained a restaurant staple, celebrated for its remarkably savory, creamy, peppery dressing. For as long, however, those same qualities made it quite difficult to replicate faithfully without the use of animal-derived products. Until today, that is! Trader Joe's Vegan Caesar Dressing uses an ingenious mix of plant-based ingredients, including tofu, capers, mustard, and miso to create a deliciously savory, enticingly peppery, and satisfyingly creamy Caesar Dressing while remaining totally vegan.
While Trader Joe's Vegan Caesar Dressing obviously makes a great vegan Caesar salad, that's hardly its only function. We find it also works fantastically as a dip, especially when paired with crudit�s, and even works wonders as a creamy, umami-rich sandwich spread.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T1wZYyIdHpbGFFjknIJt0ad7ksyCgfoS/

Because our Orange Chicken is so wildly popular, we're happy to say our vegan customers will once again have the chance to experience the deliciousness.
This offering, of course, involved removing ""chicken"" from the equation. And that involved some tinkering�but we love tinkering. One of the best things about these Morsels is that if you didn't know they weren't chicken, you'd probably think they were chicken. But because they're not chicken, but rather a chicken-y blend of soy, this Asian inspired entr�e is suitable-and quite delectable-for vegetarians and vegans alike.
This Chicken-less version, of course, includes that beloved sauce that's sweet, a little spicy, and perfectly complements the meaty-tasting Morsels.

Shredded Unexpected Cheddar Cheese,Food,"Slices, Shreds, Crumbles",$4.99 ,/8 Oz,"Having been around for almost 10 years, our Unexpected Cheddar is hardly unexpected anymore- at least for our regular Customers. Just to be clear, this is not to say that the extraordinary effect this Cheese has on one's taste buds has diminished in any sort of way! On the contrary, the smooth creaminess of finely crafted American Cheddar is still fused with the tangy, crumbly texture of a hard, aged Italian cheese... and it's still surprisingly satisfying for the cheese-lover.
Knowing the popularity of this cheese and knowing that our Customers are always looking for more ways to enjoy it, we've made the bold (and perhaps unexpected!) move to offer it in handy, Shredded form. This eight-ounce package contains large shreds of Unexpected Cheddar (an ounce more than the cut pieces we sell), ready for topping salads, soups, and open-faced sandwiches. This delicious cheese also works well in (and is now more easily added to) quesadillas, chili, sauces, macaroni & cheese � whatever meal might require the complement of this classic Trader Joe's cheese.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n9osanwMsEJnboMSkRtP-97PFQTtJ5h7/

The base is bolstered by tapioca syrup and coconut oil, and we've kept things vegan by using agave syrup as the sweetener.
In every pretty, pink pint, you'll find fruity, candied strawberries and the surprise crunch of almond brittle, which provides a cool contrast to the smooth, frozen base. And that pretty pink color? It's derived from beet juice and annatto-and the strawberries, of course!

Trader Joe's Classic English Muffins are not sweet muffins-if anything, they're a bit savory. Technically speaking, they're soft, slightly spongy (picture a sourdough-like texture), puck-shaped pieces of bread, horizontally bisected into two, equal, circular halves.
Each Muffin has a toothsome exterior (more of a ""skin"" than a ""crust,"" though), and an interior filled with plenty of...well, least we infringe upon on any trademarks, we'll say they're filled with plenty of ""pockets & crevices."" Yes, that's it. Pockets & crevices...

Last year, we even took a carb-conscious chance and added Cauliflower Gnocchi to our line-up - and, boy, was it a hit. But if Trader Joe's Cauliflower Gnocchi turned the gnocchi world upside-down, then Trader Joe's Outside-In Stuffed Gnocchi is about to turn it positively inside-out...

On its own, this would be a super hearty, profoundly delicious treat, but the addition of the mojo (a catchall in Latin American and Caribbean cuisine to describe sauces made from peppers, olive oil, and citrus juice) sauce totally kicks it into another gear, with pronounced notes of garlic, ginger, and orange zest. �Que rica!",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mM7qN6YWGTmGHz68P3rhra25CDruzxGe/

Trader Joe's Avocado Spray Oil is made from top-tier, Mexican-grown avocados, picked at peak ripeness then expeller-pressed-sans heat & chemicals, of course. It's a relatively neutral oil with a mild scent, a gentle flavor and a notably high smoke point (around 500�F), all of which make it a winning workhorse in the kitchen. Also, instead of arriving in an aerosol can, our Avocado Spray Oil benefits from bag-on- valve (BOV) technology, for a continuous spray minus the use of chemical propellants.

Plantains are close relatives of bananas. While you normally eat bananas raw, plantains are almost always cooked before eating. Where bananas are sweet, plantains are on the starchy side. And though plantains are technically a fruit, they're commonly eaten like root vegetables. When you think of them this way, Trader Joe's Plantain Chips make perfect sense.
Our Plantain Chips come from Peru, where the plantains are picked when they're just ripe enough to be slightly sweet. They're sliced and cooked in sunflower oil, then dusted with salt. They eat like sort-of-sweet, thick-cut potato chips, but with less fat than typical potato chips.

So the next time you're craving walnut shrimp, don't try to find the time to create it from scratch or call for takeout, check out Trader Joe's Honey Walnut Shrimp in our freezer case.
Inspired by numerous restaurant versions of this dish, we set out to create an easy-to-make iteration you could have on the table in less time than it would take to have it delivered. What we found with some of the restaurant versions was an abundance of batter, and pretty small shrimp. We're using large shrimp and a batter that lightly coats the shrimp, yet manages to retain its crunch even after it's been combined with the sauce. (Comparable restaurant versions are 40% batter; ours are 30% batter.)
Speaking of the sauce, it's a sweet, creamy concoction that's finished with a hint of pineapple to give the flavor a bright boost. And we couldn't have Honey Walnut Shrimp without walnuts, right? Every package contains candied walnuts you toss with the shrimp and sauce before serving. All of the components are packaged separately, and the bag has detailed instructions that will yield delicious results.
It's not at all complicated, really - saut� or bake shrimp, toss with sauce, top with walnuts. You can serve with rice or noodles or oodles of veggies.

Speaking of the filling, each triangle is packed corner-to-corner with a curry-like mixture of peas, carrots, potatoes, lentils, onions, and Indian spices. In fact, the filling makes up about 50% of each samosa (versus about 35% in other brands). The vegetables are tender and mildly spicy, offering warm flavors redolent of the Indian subcontinent.
On top of all that, it�s worth noting that these Samosas� nutritional profile (see nutrition facts below) is pretty darn reasonable for a savory pastry.

Well, because of the way our 85% Dark Chocolate Lover's Bar has been received-and consumed! Our latest dark chocolate bar sticks to this cacao percentage, but instead of coming from the Tumaco region of Colombia, the cacao in this 85% Dark Chocolate Bar comes from Uganda.
The beans are from a series of small farms in Western Uganda, located at the foot of the Rwenzori Mountains. In true bean-to-bar fashion, the cacao is harvested, dried, and fermented in partnership with a 3rd generation, family-owned Italian chocolatier. But don't assume this partnership is a long-distance relationship. In fact, one of the Italian Executive Directors is based in Uganda where he helps guarantee the origin of the beans from Ugandan farmers who still own the lands on which the cacao is cultivated.

Inspired by the same original soup dumplings, xiao long bao, that originated in the Jiangsu province of China, this type of dumpling is traditionally prepared in a xiaolong, the small bamboo steaming basket from which it gets its name. In English-speaking countries they're most often called Soup Dumplings because they are filled with hot soup (and therefore must be eaten carefully!) Xiao long bao are traditionally filled with pork, so this second entry in our freezers adheres closer to culinary tradition.
Where we've veered from the traditional preparation is with the inclusion of ginger as a major flavor player. Our recipe includes just a bit more than five percent ginger, giving these dim sum darlings a sizeable kick of pungent, spicy heat. If you have a xiaolong lying around, feel free to use it to prepare these bites. Otherwise, you can prep them the easy way, using the microwavable tray in which they're packaged.

Our A�a� Bowl is composed of organic fruit, including: strawberries, blueberries, and bananas, with unsweetened coconut chips, unsweetened coconut beverage-and of course, a�a�. We've frozen these ingredients together in a microwave-safe bowl for quick defrosting. (If you're a planner, you can alternatively just defrost your Bowl in the fridge overnight.)

Luckily, �more� is precisely what you�ll get with Trader Joe�s Triple Ginger Brew�a TJ�s holiday favorite for nearly ten years running.
When we originally set out to create our Triple Ginger Brew, we kept finding that most of what was out on the market was a little, er, lacking in the ginger department. We tasted sample after sample, until we finally found what we were looking for: a bold Brew with big bite, courtesy of the substantial amount of fresh ginger added during the brewing process. It really does offer that one-two-three ginger punch�perfect for ginger devotees like us.
While supplies last, you can find our refreshing, non-alcoholic Trader Joe�s Triple Ginger Brew in its signature emerald-green, 750mL bottle (the old-fashioned, swing-top closure is a fall fan favorite) in the sodas and sparkling waters section of your neighborhood Trader Joe�s.

Salted Caramel Hot Cocoa,Beverages,Coffee & Tea,$5.49 ,/10 Oz,"While it's generally accepted that the Mayans were the first to make a beverage out of chocolate, this drink bore little resemblance to what we now know as hot chocolate.

It's the seventeenth century Europeans, historically speaking, who get the credit for adding sugar to this bitter concoction, making it eminently more palatable and desirable.
With the introduction of Trader Joe's Salted Caramel Flavored Hot Cocoa, we'll humbly take the credit for making this classic beverage even more palatable and desirable. We've taken traditional hot cocoa mix - you know, one that's rich and creamy and sweet and incredibly delicious in every way - and added natural caramel flavor, so that every sip delivers the enhanced richness and sweetness of caramel. But we didn't stop there. Nope. We went all the way in, adding salt to the caramel flavor, so that the final result, when mixed with hot water or milk, is the warm, liquid manifestation of our ever-popular Dark Chocolate Sea Salt Caramels. A single sip simply wouldn't suffice, so a single scoop makes a nice-sized mug of salty, caramely, chocolately deliciousness.

Vanilla Almond Spiced Chai Protein Smoothie,Beverages,Juices & More,$2.99 ,/16 Fl Oz,"A long time ago in a land far, far away, chai�as we know and love it�was born. Okay, so we don�t technically know when and where the first cup of chai was brewed�but we do know that sometime in the late 19th century, Great Britain was pulling out all the stops in an effort to increase black tea consumption wide and far. Lucky for us, in India, these promotional efforts birthed the ultimate East-meets-West beverage: black tea brewed according to Indian tradition (with plenty of aromatic spices) and served according to British tradition (with plenty of milk and sugar). Hi, chai.
Now, over a hundred years later in your neighborhood store, another chai hero is born: Trader Joe�s Vanilla Almond Spiced Chai. Like the chai of yesteryear, our Vanilla Almond Spiced Chai strikes the perfect balance between comfortingly sweet and pleasantly spicy. All the usual suspects are present (cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, allspice, and black pepper), plus the addition of vanilla extract to tweak the flavor profile�but unlike the chai of yesteryear, this Chai is vegan and contains absolutely no dairy. Instead, the spices are softened by pea protein powder, almond paste, and coconut cream. And this beverage isn�t just East-meets-West; boasting 16 grams of protein per bottle, it�s also nutrition-meets-indulgence.

Tea that we, in turn, wanted you to experience, too.
With Trader Joe�s Organic Moroccan Mint Tea, we�ve simplified a few of the accustomed brewing steps, delivering full flavor in the handy form of a tea bag. Our supplier first sources organic spearmint from the Pacific Northwest�because mint tea isn�t complete without some of the finest mint leaves around. Organic lemon- grass�which adds a bit of zest�and organic green tea from South India complete the trifecta of ingredients inspired by traditional Maghrebi mint tea.
When brewed, this tea is delightful, refreshing, and oh-so minty. If you�d like to achieve the time-honored sweet tea served in Morocco, add a heaping spoonful of Organic Sugar to your mug immediately after steeping the tea. You won�t regret it. Of course, our Organic Moroccan Mint Tea isn�t just to tradition. Serve over ice with a sprig of mint for a refreshing drink on warmer days.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xSNP3ij5iJcobdZtA2O4dqfI7zuNoT7u/
Organic Ginger Turmeric Herbal Tea,Beverages,Coffee & Tea,$2.79 ,/20 Bag,"Trader Joe�s Ginger Turmeric Herbal Tea is not tea, per se�since there are no leaves of a tea plant in these steeping bags.

Now, since we are being completely thorough, we should also mention that our Ginger Turmeric Tea is significantly more than just ginger and turmeric. It also incorporates licorice root, orange peel, orange oil, and black pepper�all of which are 100% organic, as a matter of fact.
By placing one �tea bag� (there are 20 in the box) in an eight ounce cup and adding boiling water, you�re making a caffeine-free beverage that is ready to sip in 3-5 minutes.

Crafted exclusively for Trader Joe�s by an award-winning brewery in Wisconsin, this is a rich and alluringly aromatic India Pale Ale that conjures complex notes of tropical fruit and citrus zest with every estimable sip. Its near-opaque, Hazy appearance is a visually-intriguing byproduct of adding hops late into the brewing process, which helps preserve the maximum amount of hoppy flavor and helps create an almost creamy mouthfeel. In other words, this is a seriously hoppy IPA.
We recommend drinking Boatswain Hazy IPA in a tall, frosted glass, paired up with spicy entr�es or snacks�food that will hold its own next to this IPA�s creamy bitterness, like a plate of our Spicy Buffalo Cheddar or TJ�s Hot & Spicy Chicken Wings.

Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate,Beverages,Coffee & Tea,$8.99 ,/32 Fl Oz,"When it comes to brewing, what�s the difference between hot and cold? Yes, temperature, of course, but also bite. Cold brewed coffee is never heated. As a result, the oils and acids that are released commonly with heat, don�t pass through to the brew. No longer masked by the compounds that give coffee its famous bitter bite, the nuanced lush, fruity flavors of the beans becomes strikingly more perceptible and, some would argue, more enjoyable. With more than 50% less acid than a hot brewed cup, cold brew is truly smooth.
Cold brewing is hot. While we�re pro-DIY, the actual percolation and filtration can take somewhere between 12-24 hours. Don�t know about you, but our cup of coffee can�t always wait, so; we bottled it! Working with craft coffee roasters in Texas, we start with a half a pound, medium roast, 100% Arabica beans from the world�s finest growing regions. The beans are ground coarsely and specially filtered to create 32 ounces of delicious, naturally sweet, ready-to-pour Trader Joe�s Cold Brewed Coffee Concentrate. That�s equivalent to about 96 ounces of coffee beverages when reconstituted with water, milk, etc. If you like it strong and steamy, mix it with a bit of hot water for a smooth cup. Or pour it over some ice for a cold cold brew. If you want to keep the coffee as concentrated as possible, you can use it to make coffee ice cubes for your iced coffee. And since it�s ideal for adding coffee flavor without the acid bitterness, it�s even great for use in baking, marinating, making cocktails or served Affogato-style over ice cream.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KJCBf48SbcKccuHAAf2olc3rpN2q4BGP/

The stems are separated from the grapes, which are softly pressed in cylinders under pressure gently breaking their skins and releasing the juice. The juice is left to macerate on the skins for about a week in rotating temperature controlled stainless steel vinifiers at a temperature of about 28-32�C (82-86�F). The wine is then placed to age in large Slavonian oak casks.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m1VU16o5wxlkuAoggxWLWU2HN9LiL0J-/

Trader Joe's Organic Earl Grey Tea is a deceptively simple, organic blend of bold, full-bodied black tea from South India, balanced with an invigorating, floral black tea from Africa.

For an expertly brewed cup of hot Earl Grey, pour boiling water over a tea bag and brew for 3-5 minutes, then remove the tea bag and add sweetener, or follow British tradition and serve with a squeeze of fresh lemon.

Unsweetened Non-Dairy Hemp Beverage,Beverages,Non-Dairy Bev,$2.69 ,/32 Fl Oz,"Yes, hemp is a variety of the Cannabis sativa plant, but its usefulness extends far beyond therapeutic drugs. Hemp has been used for centuries to make clothing, rope, and paper-and the seeds of the plant have been used in baking and even to make beverages, as in Trader Joe's Unsweetened Non-Dairy Hemp Beverage.
Our Beverage is very simply a base of shelled hemp seeds that have been crushed and blended with water. (Think almond ""milk,"" but with hemp seeds instead of almonds.) Added to that is a little sea salt for balanced flavor and some emulsifiers to provide a silky-smooth texture. The aroma and taste is slightly nutty; even bean-y, if you will. In fact, it's surprisingly refreshing! And if you're looking for a plant-based alternative to dairy, this Hemp Beverage works on all the same eating occasions as milk: in cereal, coffee, tea, smoothies, or just chilled in a frosty mug.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D-TIUsHE7o4RWdF3W6zC3CghONiyhqFM/

Historically speaking, pomanders, whose name derives from the French pomme d�ambre (amber apple) have been around since the Middle Ages. They were originally perfume balls or bags of herbs, intended to be worn around the neck or waist, primarily to protect the wearer against illness. In the modern era, a pomander is most commonly an orange (or sometimes other citrus relative) that�s been studded with whole cloves (and sometimes cinnamon) and allowed to dry. It is commonly used as a room air freshener, or in dresser drawer to keep clothes smelling fresh.
Trader Jo�e Pomander Room Spritz captures the classic scent of orange-clove-cinnamon in a bottle, allowing you to capture the essence of a pomander with a quick spray.

Skilled artisans in Nepal use a traditional felting process to create these woolen watchdogs of the worktop. 100% New Zealand sheep�s wool is wrapped into loose balls, moistened with warm water then hand-rolled before being laid out to dry in the sun.

Finally, they�re tagged, boxed, and shipped to your neighborhood Trader Joe�s.

We�re not fans of the concept of �good� and �bad� hair days (because who is the arbiter of such things anyhow?), but we do know that certain environmental factors and elective processes (like dying, perming, straightening, etc.) can leave your hair feeling dry, damaged, and/or vulnerable to the elements. And when this is the case, you�ll likely need something a little more intense than regular-old conditioner to bring it back to life � something like Trader Joe�s Hair Mask.

Super Lemon Room Spritz,Everything Else,Household Essentials,$1.99 ,/1.69 Fl Oz,"�Odor, odor in the air; TJ�s Room Spritz shall banish thee from my lair!�
�Snow White...in the oft-overlooked epilogue to her original story
If you�ve ever been stuck in a stinky space, you know what a difference an air-freshener can make. (Snow White definitely knew�she bunked with seven male miners, for Pete�s sake!) Most space & air-freshening sprays, however, contain a myriad of harsh, synthetic fragrances�and for many, that�s more like a migraine-in-the- making than a breath of fresh air. But once upon a time, our Buyer knew that we could do better...
After a few false starts, she successfully sniffed out a solution: Trader Joe�s Super Lemon Room Spritz. Made with nothing but water, lemon myrtle oil, spearmint oil, & a sorbitol-based emulsifier (to keep the oil & water from separating), it�s truly the air-freshening alternative you�ve been waiting for. It�s light, it�s lemony�Super Lemon-y, in fact�and it�s ready drive out the funk!
A single spritz o� Spritz goes a long way, but our Buyer keeps a bottle in every room�least no bathroom, kitchen, or closet go un-freshened.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_zR9FSpRpwMYuup7nNZ9hyEdabnNlpGk/
Hydrating Hyaluronic Body Gel Cream,Everything Else,For the Face & Body,$6.99 ,/12 Fl Oz,"Trader Joe's Hydrating Hyaluronic Body Gel Cream is part of our Nourish line of health & beauty aids. The 12 fluid-ounce pump bottle contains a moisturizing Gel Cream. Yes, that's right�a Gel Cream. While it may seem odd to categorize a product such as this as both a gel and a cream, once you pump a dollop into your hand, you'll understand why. It is, at once, aqueous and semi-translucent like a gel and luxuriously rich like a cream.
Without leaving a greasy texture on your skin, our Hyaluronic Body Gel Cream offers a powerful moisturizing effect and quick absorption.

Liquid Laundry Detergent Free & Clear,Everything Else,Household Essentials,$5.99 ,/50 Fl Oz,"Many years ago, when we first introduced Trader Joe's Liquid Laundry Detergent to the world, it was one of the few ""eco-friendly"" liquid detergents on the market. With its essential oils and coconut-derived surfactants, it was actually kind of... cutting edge. But science marches forward, and times change�as do the ingredients that our customers do & do not want to see in their household products.
Our revamped Free & Clear Liquid Laundry Detergent still cleans with coconut-derived surfactants and is still hypoallergenic, but it's now also free of optical brighteners. Instead we've added stain-fighting enzymes (protease, amylase & mannanese) to the formula, improving its overall efficacy. We've also kept this Detergent free of dyes and synthetic fragrances�in fact, we�ve kept it Free & Clear of any fragrances at all! But even without added fragrance, it still does its job�grab a load of your dirtiest, stinkiest laundry and put it to the test!",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Azdk-ii3FUbgriIakXaTqrs9kUXfUtFW/

There are four bags in each package (each containing just one ingredient: dried lavender), and one bag lasts for 5-10 cycles, depending on what's being dried.

Peppermint & Tea Tree Shampoo Bar,Everything Else,For the Face & Body,$3.99 ,/4 Oz,"Trader Joe's Peppermint & Tea Tree Shampoo Bar provides a new way to shampoo. Instead of a liquid, packaged in a plastic bottle, our Peppermint & Tea Tree Shampoo is an oval shaped, solid Bar. The base of this Shampoo Bar is saponified oils (oils that have been converted into soap by reaction with alkali) that include coconut oil, olive oil, and castor oil. Added to this base are jojoba, peppermint, tea tree, and eucalyptus oils. There are also some dried mint leaves that give the white bar an attractive, green-flecked appearance. What this Bar doesn't have is parabens or sulfates!
This combination not only thoroughly cleans hair, it also creates a truly satisfying shampooing experience. Of course, this satisfaction comes, in part, from the rejuvenating qualities of Peppermint & Tea Tree oils.

It�s okay�it happens, and your secret is certainly safe with us. Perhaps you woke up late for work and had to run to catch your bus.

Almond Ginger Scent Oatmeal Exfoliant Bar,Everything Else,For the Face & Body,$2.99 ,/8.8 Oz,"Trader Joe's Almond Ginger Scent Oatmeal Exfoliant Bar has been a health & beauty favorite of customers and Crew alike since it was first launched in January 2002. We've updated its packaging from plastic to a more sustainable, gift-worthy, kraft paper wrap, but the formula remains unchanged�with one important exception. Rather than being made in the U.S. using a French recipe, the Soap is now being made for us in France, a country lauded for their superior soap-making skills.
The French milling process refines the texture of this cream-colored Bar, ensuring a long-lasting, luxurious lather every time you suds up.

Lemon Scent Dishwasher Detergent Gel,Everything Else,Household Essentials,$3.99 ,/42 Oz,"Washing dishes isn't always the most joyful activity. We can thank Josephine Cochrane for making this chore a little less nettlesome: she invented the first commercially viable dishwasher in 1886. Yes, well over 100 years ago! Dishwashers are just as useful as ever, but are only as successful as the cleaning agents you use in them. Trader Joe's Dishwasher Detergent Gel is ready and up to the toughest dish washing tasks.

The non-toxic formula has a pleasant lemon scent from essential oils and botanical extracts (with no harsh fumes), and it contains no phosphates or chlorine.
As a USDA-certified biobased product, our Dishwasher Gel is composed of biological products and renewable materials. Whereas most dishwasher detergents are mainly petroleum based, this Detergent is made with 65% biobased products.

Shea Butter & Coconut Oil Hair Serum,Everything Else,For the Face & Body,$4.99 ,/2.75 Fl Oz,"Hair is the richest ornament. - Martin Luther
Martin Luther may not be the most relevant cultural icon, but...by golly, did he know hair! Okay, we're totally making that up, but we do appreciate his 16th-century sentiment. Hair is often an integral part of one's identity�one's ornamental crown, if you will.
Certain environmental factors and elective processes (like coloring, perming, straightening, relaxing, etc.) can leave your hair feeling dry, damaged, and/or vulnerable to the elements. And when this is the case, you'll likely need a little something extra to help tame frizz and add shine...something like Trader Joe's Hair Serum.
Infused with shea butter, coconut oil, argan oil, Vitamin E, Pro-Vitamin B5, keratin, and a variety of plant-based extracts (like black currant, a�ai, & macadamia seed), Trader Joe's Hair Serum is notably silky & moisturizing, yet still lightweight. In other words, it helps add shine and luster to even the dullest of mane, all without weighing it down. It's also free of parabens, sulfates, phthalates, and surfactants (which can strip hair color & affect hair texture) and is never tested on animals.
Our Hair Serum is suitable for all hair types, and it's perfect for use before or after heat styling. Simply follow this cinchy, three-step process: 1) distribute a small amount (one pump or less to start) onto hands; 2) smooth it evenly onto dry or damp hair; 3) revel in the Serum's beachy, coconut-vanilla scent and�more importantly�in your newly softened, shiny tresses!",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZwblkGqQtYP4bkJ4YudxV8rT1h3pFCON/
Ultra Hydrating Gel Moisturizer,Everything Else,For the Face & Body,$8.99 ,/2.5 Fl Oz,"A few years ago, a few of our office Crew Members admitted to our beauty Buyer that, in spite of their TJ's allegiance, they were still shelling out the big bucks for a particular name-brand gel moisturizer. Eager to see what the fuss was about, our Buyer tried it for herself, and she was instantly sold on its light, aqueous formula.
What she was not sold on, however, was its $50(!) price tag. She knew TJ's could do better, so she contacted one of our favorite high-end skincare producers�a company overseen by a panel of board-certified dermatologists�and the rest is epidermal history.
Trader Joe's Ultra Hydrating Gel Moisturizer is the moisturizing deluge your pretty, parched visage has been thirsting for. The water-based gel formula is packed with skin-soothing ingredients, like aloe leaf juice and green tea, birch leaf, & milk thistle extracts. It also contains the holy grail of modern moisturizing ingredients: sodium hyaluronate, or the salt form of hyaluronic acid, prized for its ability to both ""lock in"" skin's natural moisture and add to it, without leaving an oily residue.
Like an oasis in the desert, our paraben-free, fragrance-free, never-tested-on-animals Ultra Hydrating Gel Moisturizer is here to rehydrate.
